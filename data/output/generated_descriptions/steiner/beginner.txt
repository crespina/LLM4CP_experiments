**The Ternary Steiner Problem**

**What is it about?**
Imagine you have a set of items, like toys or balls, and you want to group them into sets of three in a special way.

**Main variables:**
* `N`: The total number of items (toys or balls).
* `Sets`: A collection of groups, each containing three items.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**
* Each group must have exactly three items.
* Any two groups can share at most one item.

**Goal:**
The goal is to find a way to group all the items into sets of three, following the rules above, so that we have the desired number of groups (`NB`).

In simpler terms, we want to divide a set of items into groups of three, making sure that each group is unique and doesn't share too many items with other groups.
