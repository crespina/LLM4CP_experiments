Here is the explanation of the problem:

**Name of the problem:** Magic Sequence and Magic Square

**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** This problem is about finding a special kind of sequence or arrangement of numbers that has certain properties. In the case of the magic sequence, it's a sequence of numbers where each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself. For example, if the sequence has a 6, it means the number 6 appears 6 times in the sequence. In the case of the magic square, it's an arrangement of numbers in a square grid where each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same total.

**Main variables and what they mean:**

* `s` or `magic`: an array of variables that represent the magic sequence or square.
* `n`: the length of the sequence or the size of the square.
* `total`: the total sum of the numbers in the magic square.

**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**

* In the magic sequence, each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself.
* In the magic square, each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same total.
* Each cell in the magic square can only contain one number.

**Goal of the problem:**

* Find a magic sequence or square that satisfies the rules and restrictions.
* In some cases, the goal is to find all possible solutions or to count the number of solutions.
