name: Magic Hexagon Problem

description: The Magic Hexagon Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to find a configuration of numbers in a hexagonal shape such that the sums of numbers along each line and diagonal are equal to a certain value.

variables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s ∈ {1, ..., 19}

These variables represent the numbers to be placed in the hexagonal shape.

constraints: 
all_different(LD) ∧ 
a + b + c = 38 ∧ 
d + e + f + g = 38 ∧ 
h + i + j + k + l = 38 ∧ 
m + n + o + p = 38 ∧ 
q + r + s = 38 ∧ 
a + d + h = 38 ∧ 
b + e + i + m = 38 ∧ 
c + f + j + n + q = 38 ∧ 
g + k + o + r = 38 ∧ 
l + p + s = 38 ∧ 
c + g + l = 38 ∧ 
b + f + k + p = 38 ∧ 
a + e + j + o + s = 38 ∧ 
d + i + n + r = 38 ∧ 
h + m + q = 38 ∧ 
a < c ∧ 
a < h ∧ 
a < l ∧ 
a < q ∧ 
a < s ∧ 
c < h

These constraints ensure that all numbers are distinct, the sums of numbers along each line and diagonal are equal to 38, and some additional ordering constraints to break symmetry.

objective: satisfy

The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.
