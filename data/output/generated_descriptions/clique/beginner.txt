Maximum Clique Problem

This problem is about finding a group of friends in a social network where everyone in the group knows each other.

The main variables are:

* `c`: an array that says whether each person is in the group or not (true or false)
* `size`: the total number of people in the group

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* If two people don't know each other, they can't both be in the group
* We want to find the largest possible group of friends

The goal of the problem is to find the largest group of friends (maximize `size`).
