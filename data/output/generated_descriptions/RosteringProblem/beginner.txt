**Nurse Scheduling Problem**

This problem is about creating a schedule for nurses to work in a hospital. Imagine you are the person in charge of making sure there are enough nurses working each day to take care of patients.

**Main Variables:**

* `plan1d`, `plan2d`, and `plan2dT`: These are arrays that represent the schedule of nurses. They show which shift each nurse is working on each day (early, late, night, or day off).
* `shiftRequirements`: This is a matrix that shows how many nurses are needed for each shift on each day of the week.
* `s_min` and `s_max`: These are the minimum and maximum number of days in a row that a nurse can work the same shift.

**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**

* Nurses need to work a certain number of days in a row with the same shift (between `s_min` and `s_max` days).
* Weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) must have the same shift.
* There must be at least 2 rest days every 2 weeks.
* The order of shifts follows a rotating principle (e.g., after an early shift, the next shift can only be the same or a higher value, or a rest shift).
* The number of nurses working each shift must meet the required staff numbers for that day.

**Goal:**

The goal is to create a schedule that satisfies all these rules and restrictions, while also making sure that the hospital has enough nurses working each day to take care of patients.
