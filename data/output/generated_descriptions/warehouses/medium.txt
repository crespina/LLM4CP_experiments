**Warehouse Allocation Problem**

The Warehouse Allocation Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves determining the optimal allocation of warehouses to supply stores with goods.

**Decision Variables:**

* `supplier`: an array of variables that represents which warehouse supplies each store.
* `open`: an array of boolean variables that indicates whether each warehouse is constructed or not.
* `cost`: an array of variables that represents the transportation cost from each warehouse to each store.
* `tot`: a variable that represents the total cost (construction cost plus transportation cost).

**Key Constraints:**

* Each store must be supplied by exactly one warehouse.
* The total capacity of the open warehouses must be sufficient to supply all stores.
* The transportation cost from each warehouse to each store is determined by the cost matrix.
* The construction cost of each warehouse is fixed and must be paid if the warehouse is open.

**Objective:**

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the construction costs of the open warehouses and the transportation costs from the warehouses to the stores.
