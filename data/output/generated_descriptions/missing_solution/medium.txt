The Social Golfer Problem.

This problem is about arranging a group of people, with different genders and ages, into a sequence or order, subject to certain constraints.

The main decision variables are:

* `order`: an array of variables representing the sequence of people.
* `gender`: an array of constants representing the gender of each person (male or female).
* `age`: an array of constants representing the age of each person.

The key constraints are:

* The sequence of people must be a permutation of the original group (i.e., each person appears exactly once).
* Males and females must alternate in the sequence.
* The age difference between consecutive people in the sequence cannot exceed 10 years.

The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function. In other words, the goal is to find a valid sequence of people that meets the given constraints.

In this specific model, the problem is formulated as a satisfaction problem, where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, without any optimization objective.
