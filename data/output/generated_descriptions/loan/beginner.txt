Loan Repayment Problem

This problem is about borrowing money and paying it back with interest over a year.

The main variables are:
- R: the amount of money you pay back each quarter (like a monthly payment, but every 3 months)
- P: the amount of money you borrow initially
- I: the interest rate, which is like a fee for borrowing money
- B1, B2, B3, B4: these are like snapshots of how much you still owe after each quarter

The basic rules are:
- You borrow some money (P) and promise to pay it back with some extra (I) as interest.
- Each quarter, you pay back some money (R), and the amount you still owe changes based on the interest rate.

The goal of the problem is to find a way to pay back the loan over a year, with the given interest rate, and see how much you still owe at the end.
