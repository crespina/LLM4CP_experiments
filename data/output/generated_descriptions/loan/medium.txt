Loan Repayment Problem.

This problem is about finding the optimal loan repayment plan for a borrower who takes out a loan with a certain interest rate and repays it over four quarters.

The main decision variables are:

* R: the quarterly repayment amount
* P: the principal amount borrowed
* I: the interest rate

These variables represent the key aspects of the loan: how much is borrowed, how much interest is charged, and how much is repaid each quarter.

The key constraints are:

* The balance after each quarter is calculated by adding the interest accrued and subtracting the repayment made.
* The balance owing at the end of the four quarters is calculated similarly.

The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function. In other words, the goal is to find a loan repayment plan that works, rather than minimizing or maximizing a particular aspect of the plan.

In essence, the problem is about finding a loan repayment schedule that takes into account the interest rate and the borrower's quarterly repayments, and ensures that the loan is repaid over the course of a year.
