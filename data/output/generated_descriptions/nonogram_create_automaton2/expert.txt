name: Nonogram

description: A Nonogram is a puzzle where a set of clues are given to fill in a grid with two colors (usually black and white). The clues are given in the form of row and column constraints, specifying the sequence of colors in each row and column. The goal is to fill in the grid such that the clues are satisfied.

variables: A[i, j] for i in 1..Y, j in 1..X, where A[i, j] ∈ {1, 2}

The variables A[i, j] represent the color of the cell at row i and column j in the grid, where 1 and 2 correspond to the two colors.

constraints: 
∀i in 1..Y, nonogram_row(A, [rows[i, j] | j in 1..maxlen where rows[i, j] >= 0], i)
∀i in 1..X, nonogram_col(A, [cols[i, j] | j in 1..maxlen where cols[i, j] >= 0], i)

The constraints ensure that the row and column constraints are satisfied. The nonogram_row and nonogram_col predicates enforce the regular expression constraints for each row and column, respectively.

objective: The objective is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, i.e., to fill in the grid such that all row and column constraints are met. There is no objective function to minimize or maximize.
