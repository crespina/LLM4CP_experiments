name: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

description: The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a set of objects, each with a weight and a value, determine the subset of objects to include in a knapsack of limited capacity to maximize the total value while not exceeding the knapsack's capacity.

variables: x (x[i] for i in OBJ or x[i] for i in 1..n)

The decision variables x represent the number of each object to include in the knapsack. In some models, x is a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether to include the object or not, while in others, x is an integer variable representing the quantity of each object to include.

constraints: x[i] >= 0, sum(i in OBJ)(size[i] * x[i]) <= capacity

The constraints ensure that the number of each object included is non-negative and that the total weight of the selected objects does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.

objective: maximize sum(i in OBJ)(profit[i] * x[i])

The objective is to maximize the total value of the objects included in the knapsack.
