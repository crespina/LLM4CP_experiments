% Bus driver scheduling problem (prob022 in CSPLib) in MiniZinc.
%
% Specification
% Bus driver scheduling can be formulated as a set paritioning problem.
% We propose 12 set partitioning problems derived from small bus driver
% scheduling problems. These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of
% work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift
% covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost. We must select
% a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and
% only once: this is called a partition. Further,
%
% In the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is
% to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the
% total cost of the partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have
% made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to
% minimise the number of shifts.
%
% The problems come from four different bus companies:
% Reading (r1 to r5a),
% CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2),
% the former London Transport (t1 and t2).
%
% The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and
% short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features). Note
% that r1 and r1a are the same problem, but have different numbers of
% generated shifts. Similarly with the problems: c1, c1a and r5, r5a.
%
% Problems are presented in the same format as the set partitioning
% examples in ORLIB. The first line gives the number of rows (pieces of work),
% columns (shifts) and the minimum number of columns need for a partition.
% Then each line after that corresponds to one column. It starts with
% the cost (which is always 1 in our case) then the number of rows it
% covers, followed by the rows it covers.
