name: Graph Labeling Problem

description: This problem is a variant of the graph labeling problem, where we have a graph with 8 vertices and we need to assign a unique label from 1 to 8 to each vertex such that adjacent vertices have labels that differ by at least 2.

variables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h ∈ {1, ..., 8}
These variables represent the labels assigned to each vertex of the graph.

constraints: 
a ≠ b, a ≠ c, ..., g ≠ h (28 constraints)
These constraints ensure that each label is used exactly once, i.e., no two vertices have the same label.

|a - b| ≥ 2, |a - c| ≥ 2, ..., |g - h| ≥ 2 (16 constraints)
These constraints ensure that adjacent vertices have labels that differ by at least 2.

objective: satisfy
The objective of this problem is to find a feasible assignment of labels to the vertices that satisfies all the constraints, i.e., a solution that meets the conditions of unique labeling and adjacent vertices differing by at least 2.
