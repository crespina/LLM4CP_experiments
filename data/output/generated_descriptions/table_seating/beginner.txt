**The Seating Arrangement Problem**

This problem is about arranging people at tables for a dinner or a party. Imagine you have a certain number of people and a certain number of tables, and each table can only fit a certain number of people.

**Main Variables:**

* `n`: The total number of people.
* `T`: The number of tables.
* `S`: The maximum number of people that can sit at each table.
* `couples`: Pairs of people who want to sit together.
* `key`: A set of special people who cannot sit together.
* `table`: An array that shows which people are sitting at each table.
* `seat`: An array that shows which table each person is sitting at.

**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**

* Each table can only fit a certain number of people (S).
* Each person must sit at a table.
* Couples want to sit together at the same table.
* Special people in the `key` set cannot sit together.

**Goal:**

The goal is to find a seating arrangement that minimizes the total table numbers of all couples. In other words, we want to find a way to seat the couples together at tables with the lowest possible table numbers.
