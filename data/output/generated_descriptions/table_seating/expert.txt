name: Social Golfers Problem

description: The Social Golfers Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves assigning golfers to tables of a fixed size, subject to certain constraints. The problem is to find an assignment that minimizes the total sum of table numbers for all couples.

variables: table[t] (t in TABLE), seat[p] (p in PERSON)

The decision variables are table[t], which represents the set of people assigned to table t, and seat[p], which represents the table number assigned to person p.

constraints: 
forall(t in TABLE)(card(table[t]) <= S), 
forall(p in PERSON)(exists(t in TABLE)(p in table[t])), 
forall(c in index_set_1of2(couples))(not_same_table(couples[c,1],couples[c,2])), 
forall(p1,p2 in key where p1 < p2)(not_same_table(p1,p2)), 
forall(t in TABLE, p in PERSON)(p in table[t] <-> seat[p] = t)

The constraints ensure that each table has at most S people, each person is assigned to a table, couples are not assigned to the same table, people in the key set are not assigned to the same table, and the relationship between table and seat variables is maintained.

objective: minimize obj

The objective is to minimize the total sum of table numbers for all couples, where obj is the sum of table numbers for each couple.
