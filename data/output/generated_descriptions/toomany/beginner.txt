**Problem Name:** TooMany

**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a factory with several machines that can produce different colored products (red, white, black, and blue) every day. Each machine can produce a certain amount of each color, and there are rules about how much of each color can be produced.

**Main variables:**

* `n`: The number of machines in the factory.
* `k`: The total amount of products that can be produced per day.
* `produce[m,c]`: The amount of color `c` produced by machine `m`.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* Each machine can produce at most `k` products per day.
* The total amount of each color produced by all machines must be within a certain range (defined by `l` and `u`).
* If a machine produces white and black products, it cannot produce blue products.
* The amount of blue products produced by a machine cannot be more than the amount of red products.
* The amount of red products produced by a machine must be a multiple of 4.
* The amount of white products produced by a machine must be a multiple of 3.

**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to maximize the total amount of products produced by all machines while following the rules and restrictions.
