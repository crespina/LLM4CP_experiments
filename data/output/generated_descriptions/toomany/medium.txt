**Problem Name:** Production Planning Problem

**Description:** This problem involves planning the production of different colored items on multiple machines, subject to various constraints and limitations. The goal is to maximize the total production while meeting the requirements and restrictions.

**Decision Variables:** The main decision variables are `produce[m,c]`, which represent the quantity of items of color `c` produced on machine `m`.

**Key Constraints:**

* Each machine can produce at most `k` items per day.
* The total production of each color must be within the specified lower and upper bounds (`l[c]` and `u[c]`).
* If a machine produces white and black items, it cannot produce blue items.
* The production of blue items on a machine cannot exceed the production of red items.
* The production of red items on a machine must be a multiple of 4.
* The production of white items on a machine must be a multiple of 3.

**Objective:** The objective is to maximize the total production of all colors on all machines.

In essence, this problem involves allocating production capacities to different machines and colors while respecting various constraints and limitations, with the goal of maximizing overall production.
