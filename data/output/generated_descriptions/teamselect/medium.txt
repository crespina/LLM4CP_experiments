The problem is known as the Team Selection Problem.

This problem is about selecting three teams, Xavier, Yuri, and Zena, from a pool of 11 players, where each team must have exactly 6 players, including at least one goalie, two defenders, and two offenders. The goal is to maximize the total value of the selected players across all three teams.

The main decision variables are Xavier, Yuri, and Zena, which represent the sets of players selected for each team.

The key constraints are:

* Each team must have exactly 6 players.
* Each team must have at least one goalie, two defenders, and two offenders.
* The intersection of any two teams cannot have more than 2 players in common.

The objective is to maximize the total value of the selected players across all three teams, where the value of each player is given by the value array.

In essence, the problem is about finding the optimal selection of players for each team, subject to the constraints, to maximize the overall value of the teams.
