name: Team Selection Problem

description: The Team Selection Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming that involves selecting three teams of six players each from a pool of 11 players, such that each team has at least one goalie, two defenders, and two forwards, and the total value of the players in each team is maximized.

variables: Xavier, Yuri, Zena ⊆ {1, ..., 11} 
These variables represent the sets of players selected for each of the three teams, Xavier, Yuri, and Zena.

constraints: 
card(Xavier) = 6, card(Yuri) = 6, card(Zena) = 6 
These constraints ensure that each team has exactly six players.

card(Xavier ∩ GOALIE) ≥ 1, card(Yuri ∩ GOALIE) ≥ 1, card(Zena ∩ GOALIE) ≥ 1 
These constraints ensure that each team has at least one goalie.

card(Xavier ∩ DEFENCE) ≥ 2, card(Yuri ∩ DEFENCE) ≥ 2, card(Zena ∩ DEFENCE) ≥ 2 
These constraints ensure that each team has at least two defenders.

card(Xavier ∩ OFFENCE) ≥ 2, card(Yuri ∩ OFFENCE) ≥ 2, card(Zena ∩ OFFENCE) ≥ 2 
These constraints ensure that each team has at least two forwards.

card(Xavier ∩ Yuri) ≤ 2, card(Xavier ∩ Zena) ≤ 2 
These constraints ensure that no more than two players are shared between any two teams.

objective: maximize ∑(c in CAPTAIN)(∑(p in team[c])(value[c,p])) 
The objective is to maximize the total value of the players in all three teams.
