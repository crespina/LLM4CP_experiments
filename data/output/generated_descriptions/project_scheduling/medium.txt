The problem is called the "Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem" (RCPSP).

This problem is about scheduling a set of tasks with given durations and precedence constraints, where some tasks cannot start until others are finished. The goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the total duration of the project, also known as the "makespan".

The main decision variables are the start times of each task, represented by the `start` array. Each element `start[t]` represents the start time of task `t`.

The key constraints are:

* Precedence constraints: each task can only start after its predecessors have finished. For example, the task "interior walls" cannot start until the task "foundations" has finished.
* Non-overlap constraints: certain tasks, such as carpentry tasks, cannot overlap with each other. For example, the tasks "interior walls" and "exterior walls" cannot be performed at the same time.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the maximum finish time of all tasks. In other words, the goal is to complete the project as quickly as possible.
