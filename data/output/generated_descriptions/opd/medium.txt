**Orthogonal Pairs of Designs (OPD) Problem**

The OPD problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves designing a binary matrix with specific properties.

**Problem Description**

Given three integers `v`, `b`, and `r`, the goal is to find a binary matrix `m` with `v` rows and `b` columns, where each row sums to `r`. The matrix should be designed such that the dot product between any pair of distinct rows is minimal.

**Decision Variables**

The main decision variables are the elements of the binary matrix `m`, where `m[i, j]` represents the value (0 or 1) at row `i` and column `j`.

**Key Constraints**

1. **Row Sum Constraint**: Each row of the matrix must sum to `r`.
2. **Dot Product Constraint**: The dot product between any pair of distinct rows must be less than or equal to a minimum value, represented by the variable `objective`.
3. **Symmetry Breaking Constraints**: These constraints are used to break the symmetry of the matrix, ensuring that the solution is unique and not duplicated.

**Objective**

The objective of the problem is to minimize the dot product between any pair of distinct rows, represented by the variable `objective`. This is equivalent to finding the minimum value of lambda (Î») that satisfies the dot product constraint.

In summary, the OPD problem involves designing a binary matrix with specific properties, where each row sums to a fixed value, and the dot product between any pair of distinct rows is minimal. The goal is to find the minimum value of lambda that satisfies these constraints.
