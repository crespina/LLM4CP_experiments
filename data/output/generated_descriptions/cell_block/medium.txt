The Prisoner Allocation Problem.

This problem involves allocating prisoners to cells in a prison, where each prisoner has a specific cost associated with their allocation. The goal is to minimize the total cost of allocating all prisoners to cells.

The main decision variables are `r` and `c`, which represent the row and column of the cell assigned to each prisoner, respectively.

The key constraints are:

* Each prisoner must be assigned a unique cell (i.e., no two prisoners can be in the same cell).
* Prisoners deemed "dangerous" must be separated from each other by at least one cell in either the row or column direction.
* Female prisoners must be allocated to cells in the top half of the prison, while male prisoners must be allocated to cells in the bottom half.

The objective is to minimize the total cost of allocating all prisoners to cells, where the cost of allocating a prisoner to a cell is given by the `cost` array.

In essence, this problem involves finding an optimal assignment of prisoners to cells that satisfies the constraints and minimizes the total cost.
