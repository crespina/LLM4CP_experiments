The problem is known as the "2D Rectangular Cutting Stock Problem" or "2D Bin Packing Problem".

This problem is about cutting rectangular pieces from a roll of carpet to cover a set of rooms with different shapes and sizes. The goal is to minimize the total length of carpet used.

The main decision variables are:

* `x` and `y`: the coordinates of the top-left corner of each room on the carpet
* `rot`: the rotation of each room (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees)
* `kind`: the shape of each room (which set of rectangles to use)
* `l`: the total length of carpet used

The key constraints are:

* Each room must be placed within the carpet roll, without exceeding its boundaries.
* No two rooms can overlap.
* Each room must be placed according to its rotation and shape.
* The total length of carpet used must be minimized.

The objective is to minimize the total length of carpet used (`l`).
