The Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem.

This problem is about assigning courses to periods in a curriculum while satisfying various constraints and minimizing the total load across all periods.

The main decision variables are:

* `course_period`: an array that assigns each course to a period
* `x`: a 2D array that indicates whether a course is assigned to a particular period
* `load`: an array that represents the total load for each period
* `objective`: the overall objective value to be minimized, which represents the maximum load across all periods

The key constraints are:

* Each course must be assigned to a period
* A course cannot be scheduled before its prerequisites
* Each period has a minimum and maximum number of courses that can be assigned
* Each period has a minimum and maximum total load (academic credits) that can be assigned
* The total load for each period must be within the allowed bounds
* The objective is to minimize the maximum load across all periods

The problem's objective is to minimize the maximum load across all periods, while ensuring that all courses are assigned to periods and all constraints are satisfied.
