**Constrained Clustering**

This problem is about grouping things together in a way that follows certain rules.

**Main Variables:**

* `selected`: a set of connections between things (called edges)
* `rep`: a way to represent each group (called a cluster)

**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**

* If two things are connected (an edge), they must be in the same group (cluster)
* Certain pairs of things cannot be in the same group (given by `first` and `second` arrays)

**Goal:**

The goal is to find the largest number of connections (edges) that can be included while following the rules, and to group the things together in a way that makes sense.
