Constrained Clustering Problem

The Constrained Clustering Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves dividing a set of nodes into clusters such that certain constraints are satisfied.

The problem is about grouping nodes into clusters in a way that no two nodes in the same cluster are connected by a forbidden edge. The goal is to find the largest possible subset of edges that do not violate these constraints.

The main decision variables in this problem are:

* `selected`: a set of edges that are selected to form the clusters
* `rep`: an array of node representatives, where `rep[i]` represents the cluster that node `i` belongs to

The key constraints in this problem are:

* Each selected edge must connect two nodes that belong to the same cluster (i.e., have the same representative)
* No two nodes that are connected by a forbidden edge can belong to the same cluster

The objective of the problem is to maximize the number of selected edges, which means finding the largest possible subset of edges that satisfy the constraints.

In other words, the goal is to find the largest possible clustering of nodes such that no two nodes connected by a forbidden edge are in the same cluster.
