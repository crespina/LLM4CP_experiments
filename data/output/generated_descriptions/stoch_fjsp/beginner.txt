**Stochastic General Assignment Problem**

**What is the problem about in everyday terms?**
Imagine you have a set of tasks that need to be completed on different machines. Each task has a specific duration, and some tasks are optional. You want to assign these tasks to the machines in a way that minimizes the total time it takes to complete all the tasks.

**What are the main variables and what do they mean?**

* **Machines**: These are the devices that will perform the tasks.
* **Jobs**: These are groups of tasks that need to be completed.
* **Tasks**: These are the individual activities that need to be performed.
* **Optional tasks**: These are tasks that may or may not be completed.
* **Start time**: This is the time when a task starts.
* **Duration**: This is the time it takes to complete a task.
* **b**: This is a variable that indicates whether an optional task is executed or not.

**What are the basic restrictions or rules of the problem?**

* Each task must be assigned to a machine.
* A task cannot start before the previous task in the same job is completed.
* The duration of a task must be within a certain range.
* Optional tasks have specific durations and may or may not be executed.
* The total time it takes to complete all tasks on a machine cannot exceed a certain limit.

**What is the goal of the problem?**
The goal is to minimize the expected total time it takes to complete all tasks, considering the uncertainty in the task durations.
