The Transportation Problem.

This problem is about finding the most cost-effective way to transport goods from multiple factories to multiple warehouses, while meeting the demand of each warehouse and not exceeding the production capacity of each factory.

The main decision variables are the `ship` variables, which represent the quantity of goods to be shipped from each factory to each warehouse.

The key constraints are:

* Each warehouse must receive at least as many goods as it demands.
* Each factory cannot ship more goods than it produces.
* The quantity of goods shipped from each factory to each warehouse must be non-negative.

The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, which is calculated by multiplying the cost of shipping from each factory to each warehouse by the quantity of goods shipped.

In essence, the problem is about finding the optimal assignment of goods from factories to warehouses that meets the demand and production constraints while minimizing the total transportation cost.
