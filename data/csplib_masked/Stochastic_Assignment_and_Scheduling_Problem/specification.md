This is a two-stage stochastic optimization problem involving the assignment and scheduling of tasks under uncertainty.  

A set of jobs, each consisting of multiple tasks, must be scheduled on a set of machines. Precedence constraints enforce that tasks belonging to the same job must be executed sequentially. Tasks, once started, cannot be interrupted (non-preemptive scheduling). Additionally, some tasks may only be assigned to specific machines. Each machine can process at most one task at a time. The time required to complete a task depends on the machine it is assigned to, with some machines being faster than others. Furthermore, task processing times are uncertain and modeled using scenarios, where each scenario represents a case in which all processing times are known, allowing for a fully determined schedule. The assumption is that processing times become known at the beginning of the second stage.  

The problem consists of two stages. In the first stage, all tasks must be assigned to machines. Once assigned, their exact processing times are revealed. In the second stage, a schedule for each machine is constructed based on the observed processing times. The objective is to determine a task-to-machine assignment that minimizes the expected (average) makespan across all scenarios.
