These problems have various practical applications, including sensor placements for x-ray crystallography and radio astronomy. The goal is to construct a set of \( m \) integers \( 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_m \) such that the \( m(m-1)/2 \) differences \( a_j - a_i \) (for \( 1 \leq i < j \leq m \)) are all distinct. The objective is to find a configuration that minimizes \( a_m \) while maintaining this uniqueness property.

A symmetry reduction can be applied by enforcing the constraint that \( a_2 - a_1 < a_m - a_{m-1} \), ensuring that the first difference is smaller than the last.

There is no requirement that every possible distance up to the maximum length be measuredâ€”only that each measured distance is unique. However, if a configuration does cover all distances up to its maximum, it is classified as a *perfect* case.

Several generalizations of the problem exist, including:
- A modular variant where differences are unique under a given modulus.
- Configurations that must be disjoint from one another.
- Two-dimensional extensions.
- Sets of multiple configurations that share no common differences.
