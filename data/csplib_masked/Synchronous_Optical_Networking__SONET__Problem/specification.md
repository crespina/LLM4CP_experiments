This problem involves designing a network using rings to connect a given set of nodes while minimizing equipment costs.  

Each pair of nodes has a specified *demand*, representing the number of required channels for carrying network traffic. If the demand is zero, the nodes do not need to be connected.  

A *ring* is used to connect a subset of nodes. A node is installed on a ring using a device called an add-drop multiplexer (ADM), and it may be placed on multiple rings. Communication between two nodes can occur only if they share at least one ring. Each ring has a maximum capacity in terms of the number of nodes and the number of available channels. The demand between a pair of nodes can be split across multiple rings if necessary.  

The goal is to determine an assignment of nodes to rings that satisfies all demands while minimizing the total number of ADMs used.  

### Unlimited Traffic Capacity Variation  

In a simplified version of the problem, the actual magnitude of demands is ignored. If two nodes have a nonzero demand, they must be connected by at least one ring. However, the constraint on the number of channels per ring is disregarded. The objective remains to minimize the number of ADMs used.
