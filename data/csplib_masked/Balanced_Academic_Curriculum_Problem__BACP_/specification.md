The goal is to design a balanced academic curriculum by assigning periods to courses in a way that the academic load of each period is as similar as possible. The curriculum must obey the following administrative and academic regulations:

Academic curriculum: Defined by a set of courses and a set of prerequisite relationships among them.
Number of periods: Courses must be assigned within a maximum number of academic periods.
Academic load: Each course has an associated number of credits or units that represent the academic effort required to successfully follow it.
Prerequisites: Some courses can have other courses as prerequisites.
Minimum academic load: A minimum number of academic credits per period is required to consider a student as full-time.
Maximum academic load: A maximum number of academic credits per period is allowed to avoid overload.
Minimum number of courses: A minimum number of courses per period is required to consider a student as full-time.
Maximum number of courses: A maximum number of courses per period is allowed to avoid overload.
The objective is to assign a period to every course in a way that satisfies the constraints on academic load, course distribution, and prerequisite relationships. An optimal solution minimizes the maximum academic load across all periods.

Other balancing criteria could also be considered, such as minimizing deviations from the mean load per period, as explored in Monette et al.
