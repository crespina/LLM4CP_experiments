An order \( m \) structure of this type is a Latin square of size \( m \), meaning it is an \( m \times m \) table where each element appears exactly once in every row and every column. For example:  

```
1	 2	 3	 4
4	 1	 2	 3
3	 4	 1	 2
2	 3	 4	 1
```  

Such a structure can be defined using a set and a binary operation applied to its elements. The challenge is to determine whether a structure of a given size exists while satisfying additional constraints. Some of these constraints are of particular interest and have been categorized into specific cases.  

We introduce two relations, \(*321\) and \(*312\), defined as follows:  
- \( a *321 b = c \) if and only if \( c * b = a \).  
- \( a *312 b = c \) if and only if \( b * c = a \).  

Several variations of the problem impose different conditions on the operation:  
- One variation requires that if \( a * b = c \), \( a * b = c * d \), and \( a *321 b = c *321 d \), then \( a = c \) and \( b = d \).  
- Another variation requires that if \( a * b = c * d \) and \( a *312 b = c *312 d \), then \( a = c \) and \( b = d \).  
- Additional variations impose algebraic identities, such as \( (a * b) * (b * a) = a \), or similar constraints involving combinations of elements.  

Furthermore, an optional condition can be applied, requiring that every element satisfies \( a * a = a \), ensuring a particular structural property.
