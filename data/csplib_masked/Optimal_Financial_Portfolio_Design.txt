The task is to find a matrix with a specified number of rows and columns, filled with binary values (0s and 1s), where each row sums to a given constant. The objective is to minimize the maximum dot product between any two distinct rows. Equivalently, this can be seen as selecting a set of subsets, each of fixed size, from a given universal set, such that the largest intersection between any two subsets is minimized.

This problem has practical applications in financial optimization, with specific parameter ranges relevant to real-world scenarios. It is related to a well-known constraint satisfaction problem but differs in being a constrained optimization problem. A theoretical lower bound on the maximum intersection size has been established in prior work, which can be used to improve solution quality. Various modeling approaches have been proposed, including symmetry-handling techniques and local search strategies. Empirical results indicate that local search methods can outperform systematic search approaches, particularly on large-scale instances.
