A puzzle consists of the numbers 1 to 19 arranged in a hexagonal pattern:

<center><pre> A,B,C D,E,F,G H,I,J,K,L M,N,O,P Q,R,S </pre></center>
The objective is to arrange these numbers such that all diagonals sum to 38. Specifically, the following sums should all equal 38:

<pre> A+B+C = D+E+F+G = ... = Q+R+S = 38, A+D+H = B+E+I+M = ... = L+P+S = 38, C+G+L = B+F+K+P = ... = H+M+Q = 38. </pre>
This puzzle can be generalized to different sizes. For example, in a diameter 5 version of the puzzle, the arrangement follows the same rules.
