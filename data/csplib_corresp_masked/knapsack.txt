This is a problem in combinatorial optimization: given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the quantity of each item to include in a collection such that the total weight does not exceed a specified limit, while maximizing the overall value. The challenge originally arose from the situation of needing to pack a limited-capacity bag with the most valuable combination of items.
