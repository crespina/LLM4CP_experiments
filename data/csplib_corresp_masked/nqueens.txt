Can you place queens on an n×n chessboard such that none of them attack each other?

In chess, a queen attacks along its row, column, and both diagonals. The challenge here is to choose n locations on an n×n board so that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

A neat arithmetic insight helps model the situation. Represent a queen by an ordered pair (α, β) where α is the column and β is the row. Two queens don’t attack each other if they have different values for all of α, β, α−β, and α+β. While it might seem odd at first, moving one square along one diagonal leaves the sum (α+β) unchanged, and along the other diagonal, the difference (α−β) stays the same.

The puzzle also features inherent symmetry. Any solution can be transformed into another valid one by applying any of the eight symmetries of the chessboard (rotations by 90° and reflections, for example).

This puzzle is widely studied in the mathematical literature. A notable survey from 2009 by Bell & Stevens offers an in-depth look.
