This is a classical challenge in operations research. A number of activities must be scheduled. Each activity has a duration and cannot be interrupted. There are precedence relations between certain pairs of activities, meaning that one must finish before the other can start. These relations are typically given as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each edge (u, v) represents that activity u must finish before activity v begins. The DAG includes two additional activities with zero durationâ€”a source (the first activity) and a sink (the final one).

A set of renewable resources is available, each with a maximum capacity so that at any time the total resource usage cannot exceed this limit. Each activity has a demand (which could be zero) for each resource, while the dummy source and sink activities have no resource demands.

The task is usually formulated as an optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the completion time of the sink activity.

Multi-mode Variant
An extension of this basic challenge allows activities to have multiple modes. Each mode determines the activity's duration and resource demands. In this variant, the schedule must specify not only the start times of the activities but also the mode in which each activity is executed.

Non-Renewable Resources
Another extension involves non-renewable resources. Each non-renewable resource has an overall capacity for the entire schedule, such as a financial budget. In this case, the chosen modes for the activities must ensure that the capacity of each non-renewable resource is not exceeded.

Benchmark instances for various types of these scheduling challenges can be found in the PSPLIB repository.
