This challenge involves packing a set of squares with given integer sizes into a larger square so that no squares overlap and all square borders remain parallel to the border of the larger square. In this version, all squares have different sizes, and the total area of the small squares equals the area of the large square, ensuring no spare capacity. A simple variant of this challenge is one in which no subset of the squares (greater than one) is arranged in a rectangular formation.
