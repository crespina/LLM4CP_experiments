Crossfigures are the numerical equivalent of crosswords. You have a grid and some clues with numerical answers to place on this grid. Clues come in several different forms for example: 

* Across 1: 25 across times two, 
* 2: five dozen, 
* 5: a square number, 
* 10: prime, 
* 14: 29 across times 21 down
