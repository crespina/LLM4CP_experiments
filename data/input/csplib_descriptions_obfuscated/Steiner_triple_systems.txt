This problem of order n consists of finding a set of $n.(n-1)/6$ triples of distinct integer elements in $\\{1,\dots,n\\}$ such that any two triples have at most one common element. It is a hypergraph problem coming from combinatorial mathematics where n modulo 6 has to be equal to 1 or 3. One possible solution for $n=7$ is {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 4, 5}, {1, 6, 7}, {2, 4, 6}, {2, 5, 7}, {3, 4, 7}, {3, 5, 6}}. The solution contains $7*(7-1)/6 = 7$ triples.
