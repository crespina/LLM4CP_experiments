An order \( m \) structure of this type is a Latin square of size \( m \), meaning it is an \( m \times m \) table where each element appears exactly once in every row and every column. For example:  

``` 
1        2       3       4
4        1       2       3
3        4       1       2
2        3       4       1
```  

This task involves completing such a structure when only some of its entries are pre-specified. The goal is to fill in the missing values while ensuring that the completed table retains the required properties. For example, given the partially specified structure:  

``` 
1                        4
                 2        
3                1        
         3                
```  

A valid completion would be the fully specified table shown above.
