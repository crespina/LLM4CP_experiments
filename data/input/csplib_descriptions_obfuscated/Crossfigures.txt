This is a numerical puzzle similar to word-based crossword puzzles. A grid is provided along with a set of clues, each corresponding to a numerical value that must be placed correctly in the grid. The clues can take different forms, such as:

A number that is twice another number in the grid.
A specific numerical value (e.g., five dozen).
A number with special mathematical properties, such as being a square number or prime.
A number obtained by multiplying two other numbers found at specified positions in the grid.
The challenge is to determine the correct values for all positions based on the given constraints.
