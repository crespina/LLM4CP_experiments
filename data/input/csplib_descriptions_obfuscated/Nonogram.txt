This puzzle involves a grid where the solver must shade squares in such a way that blocks of consecutive shaded squares follow specific constraints for each row and column. These constraints usually describe the sequence of shaded blocks, for example, "3, 1, 2" means there is a block of 3 shaded squares, followed by a gap of any length, then a block of 1 shaded square, another gap, and finally a block of 2 shaded squares. The challenge is to fill the grid according to these rules.
