% Scheduling a Rehearsal in MiniZinc.
% A concert is to consist of nine pieces of music of different durations
% each involving a different combination of the five members of the orchestra.
% Players can arrive at rehearsals immediately before the first piece in which
% they are involved and depart immediately after the last piece in which
% they are involved. The problem is to devise an order in which the pieces
% can be rehearsed so as to minimize the total time that players are waiting
% to play, i.e. the total time when players are present but not currently
% playing. In the table below, 1 means that the player is required for
% the corresponding piece, 0 otherwise. The duration (i.e. rehearsal time)
% is in some unspecified time units.
%
%    Piece       1    2   3    4    5  6    7   8    9
%    Player 1    1    1   0    1    0  1    1   0    1
%    Player 2    1    1   0    1    1  1    0   1    0
%    Player 3    1    1   0    0    0  0    1   1    0
%    Player 4    1    0   0    0    1  1    0   0    1
%    Player 5    0    0   1    0    1  1    1   1    0
%    Duration    2    4   1    3    3  2    5   7    6
%
% For example, if the nine pieces were rehearsed in numerical order as
% given above, then the total waiting time would be:
%       Player 1: 1+3+7=11
%       Player 2: 1+5=6
%       Player 3: 1+3+3+2=9
%       Player 4: 4+1+3+5+7=20
%       Player 5: 3
% giving a total of 49 units. The optimal sequence, as we shall see,
% is much better than this.
%
% ...
%
% The minimum waiting time for the rehearsal problem is 17 time units, and
% an optimal sequence is 3, 8, 2, 7, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9.
