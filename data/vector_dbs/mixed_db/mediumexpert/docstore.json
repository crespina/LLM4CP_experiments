The cost is calculated based on the sequence of cars produced, with higher costs associated with producing cars with more options or switching between different classes of cars.\n\nIn summary, the Car Sequencing Problem is a complex scheduling problem that involves optimizing the production sequence of cars with different options and classes, subject to various constraints and limitations.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Car Sequencing Problem\n\ndescription: The Car Sequencing Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming that involves scheduling the production of cars with different options and classes.

The problem is defined as follows: given two positive integers `m` and `n`, create a sequence of `m` copies of the digits from 1 to `n`, such that any two consecutive copies of a digit `k` are separated by exactly `k` other digits.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the positions of the digits in the sequence, represented by the `x` or `y` arrays in the models. These variables represent the indices at which each digit appears in the sequence.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each digit appears exactly `m` times in the sequence.\n* Any two consecutive copies of a digit `k` are separated by exactly `k` other digits.\n* The sequence must contain all digits from 1 to `n` exactly `m` times.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIn simpler terms, the problem is about creating a sequence of digits where each digit appears a certain number of times, and the distance between consecutive appearances of the same digit is equal to the digit's value. For example, if we have two copies of the digits 1 to 4, a valid solution would be `41312432`, where each digit appears twice, and the distance between consecutive appearances of the same digit is equal to the digit's value.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Langford's Problem\n\ndescription: Langford's problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves arranging m copies of digits 1 to n in a sequence such that any two consecutive copies of digit k are separated by k other digits.\n\nvariables: x[d,c], y[p] \nx[d,c] represents the position of the c-th copy of digit d in the sequence, and y[p] represents the digit at position p in the sequence. \n\nconstraints: \nalldifferent([x[d,c] | d in DIG, c in COPY]), \ninverse([x[d,c] | d in DIG, c in COPY], y), \nforall(d in DIG, c in 1..m-1) (x[d,c+1] = x[d,c] + d + 1), \nalldifferent(y), \nforall(d in DIG, c in 1..m-1, p in POS) (y[p] = m*(d-1) + c <-> y[p+d+1] = m*(d-1) + c + 1)\n\nThe first constraint ensures that all positions in the sequence are distinct.

The arrangement is subject to certain constraints, making it a challenging problem to solve.\n\n**Decision Variables**\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the 19 variables `a` to `s`, which represent the numbers to be arranged in the hexagonal pattern. These variables are integers between 1 and 19.\n\n**Key Constraints**\n\nThe key constraints in this problem can be described as follows:\n\n* Each number from 1 to 19 must be used exactly once in the arrangement (all_different constraint).\n* The sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal to 38.\n* Certain numbers must be less than or equal to others (e.g., `a` must be less than `c`, `h`, `l`, `q`, and `s`).\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible arrangement of the numbers that satisfies all the constraints.

For example, the sequence 6, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 is a Magic Sequence of length 10, because 0 appears 6 times, 1 appears twice, and 2 appears once.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nThe main decision variables in these models are arrays of integers, representing the Magic Sequence or Magic Square. In the sequence models, the array `s` represents the Magic Sequence, where `s[i]` is the value of the i-th element in the sequence. In the square models, the array `magic` or `square` represents the Magic Square, where `magic[i, j]` or `square[i, j]` is the value of the cell at row i and column j.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\nThe key constraints in these models are:\n\n* Each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly i times in the sequence (or square).\n* The sum of the values in each row, column, and diagonal of the square is equal to a constant magic sum.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of these models is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.\n\nNote that Models 1-4 represent the Magic Sequence problem, while Models 5 and 6 represent the Magic Square problem.

The problem is inspired by Conway's Game of Life, where live cells follow certain rules to survive or die in each generation. In this problem, the goal is to find a pattern that is stable, meaning it does not change over time, and has the maximum number of live cells.\n\nvariables: `grid[r,c]` for `r, c in augmentedBoardCoord`\n\nThe decision variables are the elements of the `grid` array, which represent the state of each cell in the grid.

The grid is divided into rows and columns, and each row and column has a set of clues that specify the pattern of states in that row or column. The goal is to determine the state of each cell in the grid such that the clues are satisfied.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of each cell in the grid, which are represented by the `x` or `A` arrays in the models. These variables can take on two values, typically 0 and 1, or \" \" and \"#\", which represent the two possible states of a cell.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are the clues, which are specified by the `row_rules` and `col_rules` arrays in the models. These clues specify the pattern of states in each row and column, and the constraints ensure that the states of the cells in each row and column satisfy these patterns.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all the clues, and there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize.\n\nIn simpler terms, the Nonogram problem is like solving a puzzle where you have to figure out the state of each cell in a grid based on clues about the patterns of states in each row and column.

The shifts can be one of three types: day, night, or day off.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n1. **Consecutive Night Shifts:** A nurse cannot work two consecutive night shifts without a day off in between.\n2. **Night Shift Followed by Day Off:** If a nurse works a night shift, they cannot work a day shift the next day.\n3. **Shift Coverage:** The number of nurses working night shifts on each day must be within a specified range (lower bound `l` and upper bound `u`).\n4. **Day Shift Coverage:** The number of nurses working day shifts on each day must be at least `o`.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible schedule that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.

    The problem represented by these Minizinc models is the Quasigroup Existence Problem, also known as the Quasigroup Completion Problem.\n\nThe Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves finding a multiplication table for a quasigroup of a given order. A quasigroup is a mathematical structure that satisfies certain properties, similar to a group, but without the requirement of associativity.\n\nIn this problem, we are given an integer `n`, and we need to find an `n x n` multiplication table, represented by the `quasiGroup` array, such that each element in the table is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. The table must satisfy certain constraints, which are:\n\n* Each row and column must contain each integer between 0 and `n-1` exactly once (i.e., all rows and columns must be different).\n* The table must satisfy certain multiplication axioms, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The table must also satisfy some implied constraints, such as idempotency (i.e., `quasiGroup[i,i] = i`) and anti-Abelian properties (i.e., `quasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i]` for `i != j`).\n\nThe decision variables in this problem are the elements of the `quasiGroup` array, which represent the multiplication table.\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.\n\nThe problem is challenging because the constraints are complex and interconnected, making it difficult to find a solution that satisfies all of them. The Quasigroup Existence Problem has applications in various fields, including combinatorics, algebra, and computer science.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Quasigroup Existence Problem\n\ndescription: The Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics, which involves finding a multiplication table of size n x n, where each element is an integer from 1 to n, such that each row and column contains each element exactly once, and certain multiplication axioms hold.\n\nvariables: quasiGroup[row, col], qgDiagonal[i]\n\nThe decision variables are a 2D array quasiGroup, where quasiGroup[row, col] represents the element at row and column in the multiplication table, and a 1D array qgDiagonal, where qgDiagonal[i] represents the diagonal element at position i.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | col in nDomain]) /\\ \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | row in nDomain]) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,i] = i /\\ \nquasiGroup[quasiGroup[j,i],quasiGroup[i,j]] = i /\\ \nall_different(qgDiagonal) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i] /\\ \n(quasiGroup[i,i]=j) -> (quasiGroup[j,j]=i) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,n-1] + 2 >= i\n\nThe constraints ensure that:\n- Each row and column contains each element exactly once.\n- The diagonal elements are equal to their indices.\n- The multiplication axiom (b*a)*b = a*(b*a) holds.\n- The diagonal elements are all different.\n- The table is anti-Abelian, i.e., quasiGroup[i,j] is

with the top-ranked golfers).\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a schedule that satisfies these constraints.\n\nNote that the three models are equivalent and represent the same problem.

In other words, the problem seeks to find an assignment of balls to boxes that avoids any arithmetic progression of length three.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the `box` array, where `box[i]` represents the box number that ball `i` is assigned to.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* For any two balls `i` and `j`, if `i + j` is also a ball, then `i` and `j` cannot be in the same box, and `i` and `i + j` cannot be in the same box, and `j` and `i + j` cannot be in the same box. This ensures that no box contains a triple of balls that form an arithmetic progression.\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible assignment of balls to boxes that satisfies the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.

Each element `table[t]` is a set of golfers assigned to table `t`.\n* `seat`: a 1D array that represents the assignment of golfers to tables.

            ------\n                    The problem is known as the Water Buckets Problem.\n\nThis problem is about dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a desired distribution of water in the buckets.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of the buckets at each time step, represented by the `state` array in the model. Each element of the array represents the amount of water in a particular bucket at a particular time step.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* The initial state of the buckets is specified by the `start` array.\n* The goal state of the buckets is specified by the `goal` array.\n* At each time step, the amount of water in each bucket must be within its capacity.\n* The total amount of water remains constant throughout the process.\n* At each step, exactly two buckets change their water levels.\n* After each transfer, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the number of transfers required to reach the goal state from the initial state.\n\nIn the second model, the problem is represented as a finite state machine, where the states are the possible configurations of the buckets, and the transitions between states are the pouring operations. The goal is to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Water Buckets Problem\n\ndescription: The Water Buckets Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming. It involves dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a specific goal configuration of water in the buckets.\n\nvariables: `state[steps, buckets]`, `goal_step`\n\nThe decision variables are `state[steps, buckets]`, which represents the amount of water in each bucket at each time step, and `goal_step`, which represents the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.\n\nconstraints: \n`start[b] <= capacity[b]`, `goal[b] <= capacity[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(start[b]) = sum(b in buckets)(goal[b])`, \n`state[1,b]=start[b]`, `state[goal_step,b] = goal[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(bool2int(state[step,b] != state[step+1, b])) = 2`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(state[step,b]) = sum(b in buckets)(state[step+1,b])`, \n`((state[step, b1] != state[step+1, b1]) /\\ (state[step, b2] != state[step, b2])) -> (state[step+1,b1] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b1] = capacity[b1] \\/ state[step+1,b2] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b2] = capacity[b2])`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the initial and goal configurations are within the capacity of the buckets, the total amount of water is conserved, the initial and goal configurations are reached, exactly two buckets change in each step, the total amount of water is conserved in each step, and the pouring operation is valid (i.e., the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full).\n\nobjective: `minimize goal_step`\n\nThe objective is to minimize the number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"all_interval_medium_expert": {"node_ids": ["2edc8b5c-8b49-4441-b3b0-85ecd8c33161"], "metadata": {"model_name": "all_interval", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\n%\n% All interval problem in MiniZinc\n%\n% \"\"\"\n% Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c%, d, ...), represented by\n% numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly\n% once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover\n% the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major\n% seventh (11 semitones).

These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of\n% work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift\n% covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost. We must select\n% a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and\n% only once: this is called a partition. Further,\n%\n% In the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is\n% to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the\n% total cost of the partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have\n% made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to\n% minimise the number of shifts.\n%\n% The problems come from four different bus companies:\n% Reading (r1 to r5a),\n% CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2),\n% the former London Transport (t1 and t2).\n%\n% The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and\n% short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features). Note\n% that r1 and r1a are the same problem, but have different numbers of\n% generated shifts. Similarly with the problems: c1, c1a and r5, r5a.\n%\n% Problems are presented in the same format as the set partitioning\n% examples in ORLIB. The first line gives the number of rows (pieces of work),\n% columns (shifts) and the minimum number of columns need for a partition.\n% Then each line after that corresponds to one column. It starts with\n% the cost (which is always 1 in our case) then the number of rows it\n% covers, followed by the rows it covers.\n% \"\"\"\n\n\ninclude \"globals.mzn\"; \nint: num_work;\nint: num_shifts;\nint: min_num_shifts;\narray[1..num_shifts] of set of int: shifts;\n\narray[1..num_shifts] of var 0..1: x;\nvar 0..num_shifts: tot_shifts;\n\n% solve minimize tot_shifts;\nsolve :: int_search(\n        x ++ [tot_shifts], \n        first_fail, \n        indomain_min, \n        complete) \n    minimize tot_shifts;\n    % satisfy;\n\nconstraint\n   tot_shifts = sum(x)\n   /\\\n   forall(j in 0..num_work-1) (\n       sum(i in 1..num_shifts) (x[i]*bool2int(j in shifts[i])) = 1\n   )\n   /\\\n   tot_shifts >= min_num_shifts\n\n   % /\\ % for solve satisfy (t1)\n   % tot_shifts = 7\n;\n\n\noutput [\n  \"tot_shifts: \" ++ show(tot_shifts) ++ \"\\n\" ++ \n  \"x: \" ++ show(x) ++ \"\\n\"\n] ++ \n[\n  if fix(x[i]) = 1 then show(shifts[i]) else \"\" endif\n  | i in 1..num_shifts\n] ++ \n[\"\\n\"] ++\n[\n  if fix(x[i]) = 1 then show(i) ++ \" \" else \"\" endif\n  | i in 1..num_shifts\n] ++ [\"\\n\"];\n"}}, "car_medium_expert": {"node_ids": ["e54518ef-f560-4c76-9f70-7c935eefe97a"], "metadata": {"model_name": "car", "source_code": "%\n% Car sequencing in MiniZinc.\n% include \"globals.mzn\";\n\nint: numclasses;\nint: numoptions;\nint: numcars;\nset of int: Classes = 1..numclasses;\nset of int: Options = 1..numoptions;\nset of int: Slots = 1..numcars;\n\narray[Classes] of int: numberPerClass;\n\narray[Classes,Options] of int: optionsRequired;\narray[Options] of int: windowSize;\narray[Options] of int: optMax;\n\narray[Options] of int: optionNumberPerClass = [sum(j in Classes) (numberPerClass[j] * optionsRequired[j,i]) | i in Options];\n\n% decision variables\n\narray[Slots] of var Classes: slot;\narray[Options, Slots] of var 0..1: setup;\n\n\nvar int: z = sum(s in Classes) (s*slot[s]);\n\n% solve minimize z;\nsolve :: int_search(slot, input_order, indomain_min, complete)\n  satisfy;\n\nconstraint\n  forall(c in Classes ) (\n    sum(s in Slots ) (bool2int(slot[s] = c)) = numberPerClass[c]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, s in 1..numcars - windowSize[o] + 1) (\n    sum(j in s..s + windowSize[o]- 1) (setup[o,j]) <= optMax[o]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, s in Slots ) (\n    setup[o,s] = optionsRequired[slot[s],o]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, i in 1..optionNumberPerClass[o]) (\n    sum(s in 1..(numcars - i * windowSize[o])) (setup[o,s]) >=\n           (optionNumberPerClass[o] - i * optMax[o])\n  )\n;\n\n% for solve satisfy\n% constraint z = 82;\n\n\noutput [\n \"z: \" ++ show(z) ++ \"\\n\" ++\n \"slot: \" ++ show(slot) ++ \"\\n\"\n] ++\n[\n  if j = 1 then \"\\n\" else \" \" endif ++ \n    show(setup[i,j])\n  | i in Options, j in Slots\n];\n"}}, "carpet_cutting_medium_expert": {"node_ids": ["3b59e69c-bc01-4bf6-a1ca-0b71b75b53d0"], "metadata": {"model_name": "carpet_cutting", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\nint: n;
