The clues are given in the form of mathematical equations, and you need to figure out the correct numbers to put in each box to satisfy all the equations.\n\n**What the main variables are and what they mean:**\n\n* `M` is a 9x9 grid of numbers, where each number is between 0 and 9.\n* `A1`, `A4`, ..., `A30` are variables that represent the answers to the \"across\" clues.\n* `D1`, `D2`, ..., `D28` are variables that represent the answers to the \"down\" clues.\n\n**What the basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:**\n\n* Each number in the grid `M` must be between 0 and 9.\n* The numbers in the grid must satisfy the mathematical equations given in the clues.\n* Some numbers in the grid are fixed to be 0 (these are the \"black boxes\").\n\n**What the goal of the problem is:** The goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the mathematical equations and fills in the entire grid `M` with numbers between 0 and 9.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Crossfigure Problem\n\ndescription: The Crossfigure problem is a numerical puzzle where a 9x9 grid is filled with numbers such that each row, column, and some predefined regions satisfy certain numerical clues. The clues are given in the form of arithmetic operations and comparisons involving the numbers in the grid.\n\nvariables: M[i,j] (i, j = 1..9), A1, A4, ..., A30, D1, D2, ..., D28\n\nThe variables M[i,j] represent the numbers in the 9x9 grid. The variables A1, A4, ..., A30 and D1, D2, ..., D28 represent the numerical answers to the clues, which are placed horizontally (Across) and vertically (Down) in the grid, respectively.\n\nconstraints: \nacross(M, A1, 4, 1, 1) /\\ ... /\\ down(M, D28, 2, 8, 8) /\\ \nA1 = 2 * A27 /\\ ... /\\ D28 = D21 + 27 /\\ \nM[1,5] = 0 /\\ ... /\\ M[9,5] = 0\n\nThe constraints can be divided into three categories: \n1. The across and down predicates, which ensure that the numbers in the grid are correctly placed to form the numerical answers to the clues.\n2. The clue constraints, which define the relationships between the numerical answers, such as arithmetic operations and comparisons.\n3. The blackbox constraints, which fix certain cells in the grid to be zero.\n\nobjective: The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, i.e., to fill the grid with numbers such that all the clues are satisfied.

The problem is inspired by Conway's Game of Life, where live cells follow certain rules to survive or die in each generation. In this problem, the goal is to find a pattern that is stable, meaning it does not change over time, and has the maximum number of live cells.\n\nvariables: `grid[r,c]` for `r, c in augmentedBoardCoord`\n\nThe decision variables are the elements of the `grid` array, which represent the state of each cell in the grid. The value of `grid[r,c]` is 0 if the cell at row `r` and column `c` is dead, and 1 if it is live.\n\nconstraints: \n`grid[0,x] = 0 /\\ grid[1,x] = 0 /\\ grid[size+2,x] = 0 /\\ grid[size+3,x] = 0 /\\ grid[x,0] == 0 /\\ grid[x,1] == 0 /\\ grid[x,size+2] = 0 /\\ grid[x,size+3] = 0` for `x in augmentedBoardCoord`\n`((grid[r-1,c-1] + grid[r-1,c] + grid[r-1,c+1] + grid[r,c-1] + grid[r,c+1] + grid[r+1,c-1] + grid[r+1,c] + grid[r+1,c+1] ) = 3) -> (grid[r,c] = 1)` for `r, c in checkConstraintsBoardCoord`\n`(grid[r,c] = 1) -> (2 <= (grid[r-1,c-1] + grid[r-1,c] + grid[r-1,c+1] + grid[r,c-1] + grid[r,c+1] + grid[r+1,c-1] + grid[r+1,c] + grid[r+1,c+1] ) <= 3)` for `r, c in checkConstraintsBoardCoord`\n`grid[2,2] >= grid[size+1,size+1] /\\ grid[2,size+1] >= grid[size+1,2]`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the pattern is stable and follows the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The first constraint sets the boundary cells to be dead. The second constraint ensures that each cell with exactly three live neighbors is alive. The third constraint ensures that each live cell has two or three live neighbors. The last constraint is a symmetry-breaking constraint, which forces the assignment to respect an ordering on the values that occur in corner entries of the board.\n\nobjective: Maximize `z = sum(r in objFunctionBoardCoord, c in objFunctionBoardCoord) (grid[r,c])`\n\nThe objective is to maximize the number of live cells in the grid, which is represented by the variable `z`.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3247, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ef7be38-79da-4a76-8bb5-7585c8c51a0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ef7be38-79da-4a76-8bb5-7585c8c51a0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "mip", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.0*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\n\nsolve maximize 1.0*B - 1.0*C + 1.0*D;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 1.0*C + 2.0*D <=  4.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 3.0*C + 1.0*D <= -5.0;\nconstraint -1.0*B + 1.0*C - 2.0*D <= -1.0;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 3 :\n\n\nvar int: B;\nvar int: C;\nvar int: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.5*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 4 :\n\n\nsolve maximize 21*x + 11*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint 7*x + 4*y <= 13;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n\n\n\nModel 5 : \n\n\nsolve maximize 8*x + 5*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint x + y <= 6;\nconstraint 9*x + 5*y <= 45;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "mip_beginner_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "mip", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.0*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\n\nsolve maximize 1.0*B - 1.0*C + 1.0*D;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 1.0*C + 2.0*D <=  4.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 3.0*C + 1.0*D <= -5.0;\nconstraint -1.0*B + 1.0*C - 2.0*D <= -1.0;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 3 :\n\n\nvar int: B;\nvar int: C;\nvar int: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.5*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 4 :\n\n\nsolve maximize 21*x + 11*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint 7*x + 4*y <= 13;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n\n\n\nModel 5 : \n\n\nsolve maximize 8*x + 5*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint x + y <= 6;\nconstraint 9*x + 5*y <= 45;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n"}, "hash": "0ab892d7bcb7ee1b4eeb2ebec4a312f02dfbbc816c8f148d3875eeb608d7d90a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **Problem Name:** Resource Allocation Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three types of resources (let's call them B, C, and D) and you want to allocate them in the best way possible to maximize your profit or benefit.

    Here is the explanation of the problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Quasigroup existence problem\n\n**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a table with numbers from 1 to n, where n is a given number. You need to fill this table in a special way, so that each row and each column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, there are some rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `quasiGroup`: a table (or matrix) with numbers from 1 to n, where each row and column contains each number exactly once.\n* `qgDiagonal`: a list of numbers that represents the diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each row and each column of the `quasiGroup` table should contain each number exactly once.\n* There are some specific rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table should also satisfy some specific rules.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a `quasiGroup` table that satisfies all the rules and restrictions.\n\nNote that the problem is about finding a specific type of mathematical structure called a quasigroup, which is a set with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties. The problem is to find a quasigroup of a given order (i.e., with a given number of elements).\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Quasigroup Existence Problem\n\ndescription: The Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics, which involves finding a multiplication table of size n x n, where each element is an integer from 1 to n, such that each row and column contains each element exactly once, and certain multiplication axioms hold.\n\nvariables: quasiGroup[row, col], qgDiagonal[i]\n\nThe decision variables are a 2D array quasiGroup, where quasiGroup[row, col] represents the element at row and column in the multiplication table, and a 1D array qgDiagonal, where qgDiagonal[i] represents the diagonal element at position i.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | col in nDomain]) /\\ \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | row in nDomain]) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,i] = i /\\ \nquasiGroup[quasiGroup[j,i],quasiGroup[i,j]] = i /\\ \nall_different(qgDiagonal) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i] /\\ \n(quasiGroup[i,i]=j) -> (quasiGroup[j,j]=i) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,n-1] + 2 >= i\n\nThe constraints ensure that:\n- Each row and column contains each element exactly once.\n- The diagonal elements are equal to their indices.\n- The multiplication axiom (b*a)*b = a*(b*a) holds.\n- The diagonal elements are all different.\n- The table is anti-Abelian, i.e., quasiGroup[i,j] is not equal to quasiGroup[j,i] for i != j.\n- If (i*i)=j then (j*j) =

In other words, we want to find a solution that makes all the variables happy!\n\nNote that the three models are slightly different, but they all represent the same problem.

            ------\n                    Here is the explanation of the problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Water Buckets Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three buckets of different sizes (8, 5, and 3 pints) and you want to divide a certain amount of water between them in a specific way. You can pour water from one bucket to another, but you want to do it in the fewest number of steps possible.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `state`: an array that represents the amount of water in each bucket at each step\n* `goal_step`: the number of steps it takes to reach the desired goal\n* `buckets`: the three buckets of different sizes\n* `capacity`: the maximum amount of water each bucket can hold\n* `start` and `goal`: the initial and desired amounts of water in each bucket\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* The total amount of water remains the same at each step\n* The amount of water in each bucket can only change by pouring water from one bucket to another\n* After each step, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full\n* The goal is to reach the desired amounts of water in each bucket in the fewest number of steps possible\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Minimize the number of steps (`goal_step`) it takes to reach the desired goal.\n\nNote that Model 2 appears to be a different problem, but it's actually a reformulation of the same Water Buckets Problem using a different modeling approach.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Water Buckets Problem\n\ndescription: The Water Buckets Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming. It involves dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a specific goal configuration of water in the buckets.\n\nvariables: `state[steps, buckets]`, `goal_step`\n\nThe decision variables are `state[steps, buckets]`, which represents the amount of water in each bucket at each time step, and `goal_step`, which represents the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.\n\nconstraints: \n`start[b] <= capacity[b]`, `goal[b] <= capacity[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(start[b]) = sum(b in buckets)(goal[b])`, \n`state[1,b]=start[b]`, `state[goal_step,b] = goal[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(bool2int(state[step,b] != state[step+1, b])) = 2`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(state[step,b]) = sum(b in buckets)(state[step+1,b])`, \n`((state[step, b1] != state[step+1, b1]) /\\ (state[step, b2] != state[step, b2])) -> (state[step+1,b1] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b1] = capacity[b1] \\/ state[step+1,b2] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b2] = capacity[b2])`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the initial and goal configurations are within the capacity of the buckets, the total amount of water is conserved, the initial and goal configurations are reached, exactly two buckets change in each step, the total amount of water is conserved in each step, and the pouring operation is valid (i.e., the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full).\n\nobjective: `minimize goal_step`\n\nThe objective is to minimize the number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3326, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"all_interval_beginner_expert": {"node_ids": ["cb75e767-51d6-42f2-885d-4844381648c8"], "metadata": {"model_name": "all_interval", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\n%\n% All interval problem in MiniZinc\n%\n% \"\"\"\n% Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c%, d, ...), represented by\n% numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly\n% once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover\n% the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major\n% seventh (11 semitones). That is, for each of the intervals, there is a\n% pair of neigbhouring pitch-classes in the series, between which this\n% interval appears. The problem of finding such a series can be easily\n% formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem on Z_n,\n% the set of integer residues modulo n.

A vector v satisfying these conditions is\n% called an all-interval series of size n; the problem of finding such\n% a series is the all-interval series problem of size n.

These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of\n% work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift\n% covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost. We must select\n% a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and\n% only once: this is called a partition. Further,\n%\n% In the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is\n% to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the\n% total cost of the partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have\n% made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to\n% minimise the number of shifts.\n%\n% The problems come from four different bus companies:\n% Reading (r1 to r5a),\n% CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2),\n% the former London Transport (t1 and t2).\n%\n% The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and\n% short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features). Note\n% that r1 and r1a are the same problem, but have different numbers of\n% generated shifts. Similarly with the problems: c1, c1a and r5, r5a.\n%\n% Problems are presented in the same format as the set partitioning\n% examples in ORLIB. The first line gives the number of rows (pieces of work),\n% columns (shifts) and the minimum number of columns need for a partition.\n% Then each line after that corresponds to one column. It starts with\n% the cost (which is always 1 in our case) then the number of rows it\n% covers, followed by the rows it covers.\n% \"\"\"\n\n\ninclude \"globals.mzn\"; \nint: num_work;\nint: num_shifts;\nint: min_num_shifts;\narray[1..num_shifts] of set of int: shifts;\n\narray[1..num_shifts] of var 0..1: x;\nvar 0..num_shifts: tot_shifts;\n\n% solve minimize tot_shifts;\nsolve :: int_search(\n        x ++ [tot_shifts], \n        first_fail, \n        indomain_min, \n        complete) \n    minimize tot_shifts;\n    % satisfy;\n\nconstraint\n   tot_shifts = sum(x)\n   /\\\n   forall(j in 0..num_work-1) (\n       sum(i in 1..num_shifts) (x[i]*bool2int(j in shifts[i])) = 1\n   )\n   /\\\n   tot_shifts >= min_num_shifts\n\n   % /\\ % for solve satisfy (t1)\n   % tot_shifts = 7\n;\n\n\noutput [\n  \"tot_shifts: \" ++ show(tot_shifts) ++ \"\\n\" ++ \n  \"x: \" ++ show(x) ++ \"\\n\"\n] ++ \n[\n  if fix(x[i]) = 1 then show(shifts[i]) else \"\" endif\n  | i in 1..num_shifts\n] ++ \n[\"\\n\"] ++\n[\n  if fix(x[i]) = 1 then show(i) ++ \" \" else \"\" endif\n  | i in 1..num_shifts\n] ++ [\"\\n\"];\n"}}, "car_beginner_expert": {"node_ids": ["9cf4f8fe-74eb-400d-836a-692662a674e9"], "metadata": {"model_name": "car", "source_code": "%\n% Car sequencing in MiniZinc.\n% include \"globals.mzn\";\n\nint: numclasses;\nint: numoptions;\nint: numcars;\nset of int: Classes = 1..numclasses;\nset of int: Options = 1..numoptions;\nset of int: Slots = 1..numcars;\n\narray[Classes] of int: numberPerClass;\n\narray[Classes,Options] of int: optionsRequired;\narray[Options] of int: windowSize;\narray[Options] of int: optMax;\n\narray[Options] of int: optionNumberPerClass = [sum(j in Classes) (numberPerClass[j] * optionsRequired[j,i]) | i in Options];\n\n% decision variables\n\narray[Slots] of var Classes: slot;\narray[Options, Slots] of var 0..1: setup;\n\n\nvar int: z = sum(s in Classes) (s*slot[s]);\n\n% solve minimize z;\nsolve :: int_search(slot, input_order, indomain_min, complete)\n  satisfy;\n\nconstraint\n  forall(c in Classes ) (\n    sum(s in Slots ) (bool2int(slot[s] = c)) = numberPerClass[c]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, s in 1..numcars - windowSize[o] + 1) (\n    sum(j in s..s + windowSize[o]- 1) (setup[o,j]) <= optMax[o]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, s in Slots ) (\n    setup[o,s] = optionsRequired[slot[s],o]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, i in 1..optionNumberPerClass[o]) (\n    sum(s in 1..(numcars - i * windowSize[o])) (setup[o,s]) >=\n           (optionNumberPerClass[o] - i * optMax[o])\n  )\n;\n\n% for solve satisfy\n% constraint z = 82;\n\n\noutput [\n \"z: \" ++ show(z) ++ \"\\n\" ++\n \"slot: \" ++ show(slot) ++ \"\\n\"\n] ++\n[\n  if j = 1 then \"\\n\" else \" \" endif ++ \n    show(setup[i,j])\n  | i in Options, j in Slots\n];\n"}}, "carpet_cutting_beginner_expert": {"node_ids": ["8c43e1a4-967e-498a-9b50-5468f890502a"], "metadata": {"model_name": "carpet_cutting", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\nint: n;
