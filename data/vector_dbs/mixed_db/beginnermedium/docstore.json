You want to arrange these notes in a special order so that each note appears only once, and the distance between each pair of adjacent notes is different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes. For example, if the distance between the first two notes is 2 semitones, then there should be no other pair of adjacent notes with a distance of 2 semitones.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `x` or `series`: an array of 12 variables, each representing a musical note (0 to 11). This array represents the order in which the notes will be played.\n* `diffs` or `differences`: an array of variables representing the distance between each pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each note must appear only once in the series.\n* The distance between each pair of adjacent notes must be different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Find an arrangement of the 12 notes that satisfies the above rules.\n\nNote that the different models provided are different ways of solving the same problem, but the underlying problem remains the same.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is the All-Interval Series Problem.\n\nThe All-Interval Series Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves finding a series of pitch classes (represented by numbers 0 to 11) such that each pitch class occurs exactly once, and the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the pitch classes, represented by an array `x` or `series` in the models, which is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each pitch class occurs exactly once (i.e., the array `x` or `series` is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11).\n* The differences between neighboring notes are all different (i.e., the intervals between consecutive pitch classes are all unique).\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a series that satisfies these constraints.\n\nNote that there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize in this problem. The goal is to find a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2668, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4a76865-5bc5-4e14-87f8-d2b7af3565d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4a76865-5bc5-4e14-87f8-d2b7af3565d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "assign", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\nint: n;\nset of int: WORK = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: TASK = 1..m;\narray[WORK,TASK] of int: profit;\narray[WORK] of var TASK: x;\n% new\narray[WORK] of var int: px =\n     [ profit[w,x[w]] | w in WORK ];\nvar int: obj = sum(w in WORK)(px[w]);\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(x);\n\nann: varselect;\nann: valselect;\n\nsolve :: int_search(px, varselect, valselect, complete)\n      maximize obj;\n\noutput [\"obj = \\(obj); x = \\(x);\\n\"];\n\n\nvarselect = largest;\nvalselect = indomain_min;\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[DOM] of var COD: task;\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"inverse.mzn\";\nconstraint inverse(task,worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(w in COD)\n            (profit[w,task[w]]);\n\noutput [show(task)];\n\n\n\nModel 3 : \n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(t in COD)\n            (profit[worker[t],t]);\n\noutput [show(worker)];\n"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "assign_beginner_medium", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "assign", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\nint: n;\nset of int: WORK = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: TASK = 1..m;\narray[WORK,TASK] of int: profit;\narray[WORK] of var TASK: x;\n% new\narray[WORK] of var int: px =\n     [ profit[w,x[w]] | w in WORK ];\nvar int: obj = sum(w in WORK)(px[w]);\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(x);\n\nann: varselect;\nann: valselect;\n\nsolve :: int_search(px, varselect, valselect, complete)\n      maximize obj;\n\noutput [\"obj = \\(obj); x = \\(x);\\n\"];\n\n\nvarselect = largest;\nvalselect = indomain_min;\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[DOM] of var COD: task;\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"inverse.mzn\";\nconstraint inverse(task,worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(w in COD)\n            (profit[w,task[w]]);\n\noutput [show(task)];\n\n\n\nModel 3 : \n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(t in COD)\n            (profit[worker[t],t]);\n\noutput [show(worker)];\n"}, "hash": "7faaef7004a92a78fbdbf705f4ddc743530d383e67abbef55c657b7456bdd70f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **The Assignment Problem**\n\n**What is it about?**\nImagine you have a group of workers and a list of tasks that need to be done.

The profit is calculated as the sum of the profits obtained from each task-worker pair.\n\nIn the provided models, the profit is represented by the `profit` array, where `profit[w,t]` represents the profit obtained from assigning task `t` to worker `w`. The objective is to maximize the sum of these profits.\n\nThe models use different constraints and search strategies to solve the problem.

The `solve` statement uses a boolean search strategy to find a solution, and the `output` statement is used to print the solution in a human-readable format.\n\nNote that the model also includes some symmetry-breaking constraints to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of the solver.

The cost is calculated based on the sequence of cars produced, with higher costs associated with producing cars with more options or switching between different classes of cars.\n\nIn summary, the Car Sequencing Problem is a complex scheduling problem that involves optimizing the production sequence of cars with different options and classes, subject to various constraints and limitations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3148, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89cd153a-1b4d-4d5b-af2c-e77950af51a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "89cd153a-1b4d-4d5b-af2c-e77950af51a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "carpet_cutting", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\nint: n;

The equation is:\n\n(A / (B*C)) + (D / (E*F)) + (G / (H*I)) = 1\n\nThe main decision variables are the digits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, which represent the numerators and denominators of the three fractions.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* Each digit must be distinct and non-zero.\n* The equation above must hold.\n* Some symmetry-breaking constraints are added to reduce the search space:\n\t+ A*D2 >= D*D1 (to avoid swapping the first two fractions)\n\t+ D*D3 >= G*D2 (to avoid swapping the last two fractions)\n* Some redundant constraints are added to help the solver:\n\t+ 3*A >= D1 (to reduce the possible values of A)\n\t+ 3*G <= D2 (to reduce the possible values of G)\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than to minimize or maximize a specific objective function. The problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem, where the goal is to find a feasible solution that meets all the constraints.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c71bc97-3195-4c1f-8a80-aa591dab3fa2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c71bc97-3195-4c1f-8a80-aa591dab3fa2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "golfers", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\n\n% The social golfers problem\n% A club has a number of golfers that play rounds in groups (the number of\n% golfers is a multiple of the number of groups).

Each `x[i,j]` represents the value of the cell at row `i` and column `j`.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each row, column, and nonet must contain each number exactly once.\n* The sum of the values in each cage must equal the specified total value for that cage.\n* No number can be repeated within a cage.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all these constraints.\n\nIn the provided models, the `solve` statement is set to `satisfy`, which means that the objective is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2534, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f173d0e9-26cf-42c1-9ede-d35d4b9123bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "f173d0e9-26cf-42c1-9ede-d35d4b9123bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "knapsack", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\nint: n;

Each number should appear m times in the sequence. The rule is that if a number k appears, the next time it appears, it should be k+1 positions later in the sequence.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* n: the highest number in the set (e.g., if n=4, the set is {1, 2, 3, 4})\n* m: how many times each number should appear in the sequence\n* x (or y): the sequence of numbers, where each number is a position in the sequence\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each number from 1 to n should appear m times in the sequence.\n* If a number k appears, the next time it appears, it should be k+1 positions later in the sequence.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a sequence that satisfies the rules above.\n\nNote that the different models are just different ways of representing the same problem, and the explanation above applies to all of them.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    Langford's Problem.\n\nLangford's Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves arranging a sequence of digits in a specific way. The problem is defined as follows: given two positive integers `m` and `n`, create a sequence of `m` copies of the digits from 1 to `n`, such that any two consecutive copies of a digit `k` are separated by exactly `k` other digits.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the positions of the digits in the sequence, represented by the `x` or `y` arrays in the models.

In the case of the magic sequence, it's a sequence of numbers where each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself. For example, if the sequence has a 6, it means the number 6 appears 6 times in the sequence. In the case of the magic square, it's an arrangement of numbers in a square grid where each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same total.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `s` or `magic`: an array of variables that represent the magic sequence or square.\n* `n`: the length of the sequence or the size of the square.\n* `total`: the total sum of the numbers in the magic square.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* In the magic sequence, each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself.\n* In the magic square, each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same total.\n* Each cell in the magic square can only contain one number.\n\n**Goal of the problem:**\n\n* Find a magic sequence or square that satisfies the rules and restrictions.\n* In some cases, the goal is to find all possible solutions or to count the number of solutions.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem represented by these Minizinc models is the Magic Sequence/Magic Square problem.\n\n**Problem Description:**\nA Magic Sequence/Magic Square is an arrangement of integers in a sequence or square grid, such that each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly i times in the sequence, where i is the value of the integer. For example, the sequence 6, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 is a Magic Sequence of length 10, because 0 appears 6 times, 1 appears twice, and 2 appears once.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nThe main decision variables in these models are arrays of integers, representing the Magic Sequence or Magic Square. In the sequence models, the array `s` represents the Magic Sequence, where `s[i]` is the value of the i-th element in the sequence. In the square models, the array `magic` or `square` represents the Magic Square, where `magic[i, j]` or `square[i, j]` is the value of the cell at row i and column j.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\nThe key constraints in these models are:\n\n* Each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly i times in the sequence (or square).\n* The sum of the values in each row, column, and diagonal of the square is equal to a constant magic sum.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of these models is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.\n\nNote that Models 1-4 represent the Magic Sequence problem, while Models 5 and 6 represent the Magic Square problem.

You have some limitations on how much of each resource you can use, and you want to find the optimal combination that gives you the highest return.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* B, C, and D: These are the three types of resources you have. They can be thought of as quantities of something (e.g., money, materials, labor).\n* x and y: In some models, these are used instead of B and C, but they represent the same idea - quantities of resources.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* You can't use more resources than you have available (represented by the \"less than or equal to\" constraints).\n* You can't use a negative amount of resources (represented by the \"greater than or equal to 0\" constraints).\n\n**Goal of the problem:**\n\n* Maximize the total benefit or profit you get from allocating the resources. This is represented by the \"maximize\" objective function, which combines the resources in a specific way to give you a total value.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is a classic Linear Programming (LP) problem, specifically a Resource Allocation problem.\n\n**Description:**\nThe problem involves allocating resources to different activities or products to maximize profit or minimize cost, while satisfying certain constraints. In this case, we have three variables, B, C, and D, which represent the quantities of three different products or activities.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nThe decision variables are B, C, and D, which represent the quantities of the three products or activities. These variables can take on non-negative values, indicating the amount of each product or activity to allocate.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\nThe constraints can be described as follows:\n\n* The total amount of resources used by the three products or activities cannot exceed certain limits (e.g., 30, 25, and 20 units).\n* Each product or activity has a specific resource requirement, and the total resource usage must not exceed the available resources.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit or value obtained from the allocation of resources to the three products or activities. The profit or value is calculated as a linear combination of the quantities of each product or activity, with different coefficients (e.g., 3, 1, and 3) representing the profit or value per unit of each product or activity.\n\nIn summary, the problem involves finding the optimal allocation of resources to three products or activities to maximize profit or value, while satisfying resource constraints.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2930, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beb855ff-5421-472a-b89a-feab8f0b2c13": {"__data__": {"id_": "beb855ff-5421-472a-b89a-feab8f0b2c13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "missing_solution", "source_code": "% Missing Solutions\nint: n; % no of people\nset of int: PERSON = 1..n;\nint: male = 1; int: female = 2;\nset of int: GENDER = male..female;\narray[PERSON] of GENDER: gender;\narray[PERSON] of int: age;\n\narray[1..n] of var PERSON: order;\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(order);\n\n% males and females alternate\nconstraint forall(i in 1..n)\n                 (i mod 2 = 0 <-> gender[order[i]] = female);\n\n% age does not grow bu more than 10\nconstraint forall(i in 1..n-1)\n                 (age[order[i+1]] - age[order[i]] <= 10);\n\nsolve satisfy;\n\noutput [ show(order), \"\\n\"] ++\n       [\"[\"] ++ [ show(age[order[i]]) ++ if i < n then \", \" else \"]\\n\" endif\n                | i in 1..n ] ++\n       [\"[\"] ++ [ show(gender[order[i]]) ++ if i < n then \", \" else \"]\\n\" endif\n                 | i in 1..n ];\n\n\n%n = 6;\n%gender = [male,male,male,female,female,female];\n%age = [13, 25, 34, 40, 16, 13];\n\nn = 5;\ngender = [male,male,female,female,female];\nage = [13,25,34,40,16];\n\n%order = [4,2,3,1,5];\n"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "missing_solution_beginner_medium", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "missing_solution", "source_code": "% Missing Solutions\nint: n; % no of people\nset of int: PERSON = 1..n;\nint: male = 1; int: female = 2;\nset of int: GENDER = male..female;\narray[PERSON] of GENDER: gender;\narray[PERSON] of int: age;\n\narray[1..n] of var PERSON: order;\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(order);\n\n% males and females alternate\nconstraint forall(i in 1..n)\n                 (i mod 2 = 0 <-> gender[order[i]] = female);\n\n% age does not grow bu more than 10\nconstraint forall(i in 1..n-1)\n                 (age[order[i+1]] - age[order[i]] <= 10);\n\nsolve satisfy;\n\noutput [ show(order), \"\\n\"] ++\n       [\"[\"] ++ [ show(age[order[i]]) ++ if i < n then \", \" else \"]\\n\" endif\n                | i in 1..n ] ++\n       [\"[\"] ++ [ show(gender[order[i]]) ++ if i < n then \", \" else \"]\\n\" endif\n                 | i in 1..n ];\n\n\n%n = 6;\n%gender = [male,male,male,female,female,female];\n%age = [13, 25, 34, 40, 16, 13];\n\nn = 5;\ngender = [male,male,female,female,female];\nage = [13,25,34,40,16];\n\n%order = [4,2,3,1,5];\n"}, "hash": "3f29dded6b324f55c6666b04209ba0618afeea7169454584ff4a963795fc389f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **Seating Arrangement Problem**\n\nThis problem is about arranging people in a line, like in a queue or at a table, in a specific order.\n\n**Main Variables:**\n\n* `n`: The number of people.\n* `gender`: An array that stores the gender of each person (male or female).\n* `age`: An array that stores the age of each person.\n* `order`: An array that stores the order in which the people should be arranged.\n\n**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**\n\n* The people should be arranged in a line, one after the other.\n* Males and females should alternate in the line (i.e., a male should be followed by a female, and vice versa).\n* The age difference between two people sitting next to each other should not be more than 10 years.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find an arrangement of people that satisfies all the above rules.

Imagine you have a grid of squares, and you need to fill some of them with colors (let's say black and white) to create a specific image. The rules tell you how many consecutive squares of each color should be in each row and column.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `x` or `A`: a 2D array that represents the grid of squares, where each square can be either 1 (white) or 2 (black).\n* `rows` and `cols`: 2D arrays that contain the rules for each row and column, respectively.\n* `row_rules` and `col_rules`: 2D arrays that contain the specific rules for each row and column.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each row and column must follow the rules specified in `rows` and `cols`, respectively.\n* The rules specify how many consecutive squares of each color should be in each row and column.\n\n**Goal:**\nThe goal is to find a valid configuration of the grid that satisfies all the rules, creating a specific image.\n\nIn simpler terms, the problem is about solving a puzzle where you need to fill a grid with black and white squares according to some rules, and the goal is to create a specific picture.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is called the Nonogram problem.\n\nThe Nonogram problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves solving a puzzle where a set of clues are given to determine the state of a grid. The grid is divided into rows and columns, and each row and column has a set of clues that specify the pattern of states in that row or column. The goal is to determine the state of each cell in the grid such that the clues are satisfied.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of each cell in the grid, which are represented by the `x` or `A` arrays in the models. These variables can take on two values, typically 0 and 1, or \" \" and \"#\", which represent the two possible states of a cell.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are the clues, which are specified by the `row_rules` and `col_rules` arrays in the models. These clues specify the pattern of states in each row and column, and the constraints ensure that the states of the cells in each row and column satisfy these patterns.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all the clues, and there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize.\n\nIn simpler terms, the Nonogram problem is like solving a puzzle where you have to figure out the state of each cell in a grid based on clues about the patterns of states in each row and column. The clues are like hints that help you determine the solution, and the goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the clues.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2875, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7a2a677-1f6b-4681-8806-24bdca7404c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7a2a677-1f6b-4681-8806-24bdca7404c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "nurses", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\nint: k;

Imagine you are the manager of a hospital and you need to create a schedule for your nurses to work over a certain number of days.\n\nThe main variables are:\n\n* Nurses (represented by numbers 1 to k): These are the people who will be working at the hospital.\n* Days (represented by numbers 1 to m): These are the days of the week/month that the nurses will be working.\n* Shifts (represented by numbers 1 to 3): These are the different types of shifts that the nurses can work, such as day shift, night shift, or a day off.\n\nThe basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:\n\n* If a nurse works a night shift two days in a row, they must have a day off on the third day.\n* If a nurse works a night shift, they cannot work a day shift the next day.\n* There must be a certain number of nurses working the night shift each day (between a lower and upper bound).\n\nThe goal of the problem is to create a schedule that satisfies all these rules and restrictions.\n\nNote that the two models are essentially the same, with the second model being a slightly different implementation of the same problem.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    **Nurse Rostering Problem**\n\nThe Nurse Rostering Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves creating a schedule for a set of nurses to work on different days and shifts.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the assignments of nurses to shifts on different days, represented by a 2D array `x` where `x[n,d]` represents the shift assigned to nurse `n` on day `d`. The shifts can be one of three types: day, night, or day off.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n1. **Consecutive Night Shifts:** A nurse cannot work two consecutive night shifts without a day off in between.\n2. **Night Shift Followed by Day Off:** If a nurse works a night shift, they cannot work a day shift the next day.\n3. **Shift Coverage:** The number of nurses working night shifts on each day must be within a specified range (lower bound `l` and upper bound `u`).\n4. **Day Shift Coverage:** The number of nurses working day shifts on each day must be at least `o`.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible schedule that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function. The goal is to assign shifts to nurses in a way that meets the requirements and rules of the problem.\n\nIn summary, the Nurse Rostering Problem involves creating a schedule for nurses to work on different days and shifts, subject to constraints on consecutive night shifts, shift coverage, and day shift coverage.

The matrix should be designed such that the dot product between any pair of distinct rows is minimal.\n\n**Decision Variables**\n\nThe main decision variables are the elements of the binary matrix `m`, where `m[i, j]` represents the value (0 or 1) at row `i` and column `j`.\n\n**Key Constraints**\n\n1. **Row Sum Constraint**: Each row of the matrix must sum to `r`.\n2. **Dot Product Constraint**: The dot product between any pair of distinct rows must be less than or equal to a minimum value, represented by the variable `objective`.\n3. **Symmetry Breaking Constraints**: These constraints are used to break the symmetry of the matrix, ensuring that the solution is unique and not duplicated.\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the dot product between any pair of distinct rows, represented by the variable `objective`. This is equivalent to finding the minimum value of lambda (\u03bb) that satisfies the dot product constraint.\n\nIn summary, the OPD problem involves designing a binary matrix with specific properties, where each row sums to a fixed value, and the dot product between any pair of distinct rows is minimal.

Here is the explanation of the problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Quasigroup existence problem\n\n**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a table with numbers from 1 to n, where n is a given number. You need to fill this table in a special way, so that each row and each column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, there are some rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `quasiGroup`: a table (or matrix) with numbers from 1 to n, where each row and column contains each number exactly once.\n* `qgDiagonal`: a list of numbers that represents the diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each row and each column of the `quasiGroup` table should contain each number exactly once.\n* There are some specific rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table should also satisfy some specific rules.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a `quasiGroup` table that satisfies all the rules and restrictions.\n\nNote that the problem is about finding a specific type of mathematical structure called a quasigroup, which is a set with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties. The problem is to find a quasigroup of a given order (i.e., with a given number of elements).\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem represented by these Minizinc models is the Quasigroup Existence Problem, also known as the Quasigroup Completion Problem.\n\nThe Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves finding a multiplication table for a quasigroup of a given order. A quasigroup is a mathematical structure that satisfies certain properties, similar to a group, but without the requirement of associativity.\n\nIn this problem, we are given an integer `n`, and we need to find an `n x n` multiplication table, represented by the `quasiGroup` array, such that each element in the table is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. The table must satisfy certain constraints, which are:\n\n* Each row and column must contain each integer between 0 and `n-1` exactly once (i.e., all rows and columns must be different).\n* The table must satisfy certain multiplication axioms, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The table must also satisfy some implied constraints, such as idempotency (i.e., `quasiGroup[i,i] = i`) and anti-Abelian properties (i.e., `quasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i]` for `i != j`).\n\nThe decision variables in this problem are the elements of the `quasiGroup` array, which represent the multiplication table.\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.\n\nThe problem is challenging because the constraints are complex and interconnected, making it difficult to find a solution that satisfies all of them.

Each `s[t]` represents the start time of task `t`.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Precedence constraints: Each task can only start after its predecessors have finished. This is ensured by the constraint `s[pre[p,1]] + d[pre[p,1]] <= s[pre[p,2]]`, which states that the start time of a task plus its duration must be less than or equal to the start time of its successor.\n* Resource constraints: The total resource usage of all tasks at any given time must not exceed the available resource limit. This is ensured by the cumulative constraint, which is implemented using the `cumulative` function from the `cumulative.mzn` library.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the maximum completion time of all tasks, which is equivalent to minimizing the project duration.

There are 9 pieces of music to be rehearsed, and 5 musicians will be participating. Each musician is required for some pieces, but not all. You want to find the best order to rehearse the pieces so that the musicians don't have to wait too long between their performances.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `rehearsal_order`: the order in which the pieces will be rehearsed\n* `waiting_time`: the time each musician spends waiting between their performances\n* `total_waiting_time`: the total time all musicians spend waiting\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each musician can arrive at the rehearsal just before their first piece and leave just after their last piece.\n* Each piece has a specific duration (length of time it takes to rehearse).\n* The order of the pieces must be determined so that each musician's waiting time is minimized.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Find the order of the pieces that minimizes the total waiting time for all musicians.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is called the \"Rehearsal Scheduling Problem\".\n\nThis problem is about scheduling a rehearsal for a concert where nine pieces of music need to be rehearsed by five orchestra players.

Imagine you are the person in charge of making sure there are enough nurses working each day to take care of patients.\n\n**Main Variables:**\n\n* `plan1d`, `plan2d`, and `plan2dT`: These are arrays that represent the schedule of nurses. They show which shift each nurse is working on each day (early, late, night, or day off).\n* `shiftRequirements`: This is a matrix that shows how many nurses are needed for each shift on each day of the week.\n* `s_min` and `s_max`: These are the minimum and maximum number of days in a row that a nurse can work the same shift.\n\n**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**\n\n* Nurses need to work a certain number of days in a row with the same shift (between `s_min` and `s_max` days).\n* Weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) must have the same shift.\n* There must be at least 2 rest days every 2 weeks.\n* The order of shifts follows a rotating principle (e.g., after an early shift, the next shift can only be the same or a higher value, or a rest shift).\n* The number of nurses working each shift must meet the required staff numbers for that day.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to create a schedule that satisfies all these rules and restrictions, while also making sure that the hospital has enough nurses working each day to take care of patients.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    **Nurse Rostering Problem**\n\nThe Nurse Rostering Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves creating a schedule for nurses to work in a hospital. The goal is to assign nurses to shifts while satisfying various constraints, such as ensuring that each shift has the required number of staff, and that nurses get adequate rest days.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the `plan1d`, `plan2d`, and `plan2dT` arrays, which represent the assignment of nurses to shifts. Each element in these arrays corresponds to a specific day and shift, and its value indicates the type of shift assigned (early, late, night, or rest day).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n1. **Weekend constraint**: Saturday and Sunday shifts must be the same for each week.\n2. **Shift repetition constraint**: Each shift type must have a minimum and maximum number of consecutive assignments.\n3. **Rest day constraint**: At least two rest days must be assigned every two weeks.\n4. **Shift order constraint**: The order of shifts must follow a forward-rotating principle, where an early shift can only be followed by a shift with the same or higher value, or a rest shift.\n5. **Shift requirement constraint**: The number of staff required for each shift must be satisfied.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible schedule that satisfies all the constraints. There is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize, as the goal is to find a valid solution that meets all the requirements.\n\nIn summary, the Nurse Rostering Problem is a complex constraint programming problem that involves assigning nurses to shifts while satisfying various constraints related to shift repetition, rest days, shift order, and staff requirements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd6fb846-3af4-4742-8f44-2637f69dfe28": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd6fb846-3af4-4742-8f44-2637f69dfe28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "sb", "source_code": "% Solitaire Battleships is a puzzle where\n% we are given a partially filled in board and the number\n% of ships in each row and column and have to fill it with ships\n \n% \"Improved\" version does not introduce reified set_in\n\nint: width;

Each element `rings[i, j]` is a boolean value indicating whether node `j` is assigned to ring `i`.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* If there is a demand for communication between two nodes, they must be assigned to the same ring.\n* The number of nodes assigned to each ring must not exceed the ring's capacity.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the total number of ADMs used, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of all elements in the `rings` matrix.\n\nIn other words, the problem is to find the most efficient way to connect the nodes that require communication, using the minimum number of rings and ADMs, while ensuring that each ring does not exceed its capacity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50261606-6133-4bd7-bc2a-3a137cc5306e": {"__data__": {"id_": "50261606-6133-4bd7-bc2a-3a137cc5306e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "square_pack", "source_code": "int: n; % number of squares\nset of int: SQUARE = 1..n;\nint: maxl = sum(i in SQUARE)(i);\nint: mina = sum(i in SQUARE)(i*i);\n\nvar n..maxl: height;\nvar n..maxl: width;\nvar mina .. n*maxl: area = height * width;\n\narray[SQUARE] of var 0..maxl: x;\narray[SQUARE] of var 0..maxl: y;\n\n% squares fit in the rectangle\nconstraint forall(s in SQUARE)(x[s] + s <= width);\nconstraint forall(s in SQUARE)(y[s] + s <= height);\n\n% non overlap\nconstraint forall(s1, s2 in SQUARE where s1 < s2)\n                 (x[s1] + s1 <= x[s2] \\/\n                  x[s2] + s2 <= x[s1] \\/  \n                  y[s1] + s1 <= y[s2] \\/ \n                  y[s2] + s2 <= y[s1]);\narray[SQUARE] of int: size = [ i | i in SQUARE ];\n\n% non overlap with global diffn\ninclude \"diffn.mzn\";\n%constraint diffn(x,y,size,size);\n\n% redundant cumulative constraints\ninclude \"cumulative.mzn\";\n%constraint cumulative(x,size,size,height);\n%constraint cumulative(y,size,size,width);\n\n% variables ordered in reverse size x[n], y[n], x[n-1], y[n-1], ..., x[1], y[1]\n%array[1..2*n] of var 0..maxl: vs = [ if i mod 2 = 0 then x[n+1 - i div 2] \n%                                     else y[n+1 - i div 2] endif | i in 2..2*n+1 ];\n\nsolve :: seq_search([\n         int_search([area,height,width], input_order, indomain_min, complete) \n         %,int_search(vs, input_order, indomain_min, complete)\n         ])\n      minimize area;\n\noutput [\"area = \",show(area), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"height = \",show(height), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"width = \",show(width), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"x = \", show(x), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"y = \", show(y), \"\\n\"];\n"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "square_pack_beginner_medium", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "square_pack", "source_code": "int: n; % number of squares\nset of int: SQUARE = 1..n;\nint: maxl = sum(i in SQUARE)(i);\nint: mina = sum(i in SQUARE)(i*i);\n\nvar n..maxl: height;\nvar n..maxl: width;\nvar mina .. n*maxl: area = height * width;\n\narray[SQUARE] of var 0..maxl: x;\narray[SQUARE] of var 0..maxl: y;\n\n% squares fit in the rectangle\nconstraint forall(s in SQUARE)(x[s] + s <= width);\nconstraint forall(s in SQUARE)(y[s] + s <= height);\n\n% non overlap\nconstraint forall(s1, s2 in SQUARE where s1 < s2)\n                 (x[s1] + s1 <= x[s2] \\/\n                  x[s2] + s2 <= x[s1] \\/  \n                  y[s1] + s1 <= y[s2] \\/ \n                  y[s2] + s2 <= y[s1]);\narray[SQUARE] of int: size = [ i | i in SQUARE ];\n\n% non overlap with global diffn\ninclude \"diffn.mzn\";\n%constraint diffn(x,y,size,size);\n\n% redundant cumulative constraints\ninclude \"cumulative.mzn\";\n%constraint cumulative(x,size,size,height);\n%constraint cumulative(y,size,size,width);\n\n% variables ordered in reverse size x[n], y[n], x[n-1], y[n-1], ..., x[1], y[1]\n%array[1..2*n] of var 0..maxl: vs = [ if i mod 2 = 0 then x[n+1 - i div 2] \n%                                     else y[n+1 - i div 2] endif | i in 2..2*n+1 ];\n\nsolve :: seq_search([\n         int_search([area,height,width], input_order, indomain_min, complete) \n         %,int_search(vs, input_order, indomain_min, complete)\n         ])\n      minimize area;\n\noutput [\"area = \",show(area), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"height = \",show(height), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"width = \",show(width), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"x = \", show(x), \"\\n\"] ++\n[\"y = \", show(y), \"\\n\"];\n"}, "hash": "69fa7241f33d3254c6e95071e8a69cd586ff88c5b77b720ca37c8b2a3eb06c62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **Problem Name:** Square Packing Problem\n\n**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a set of squares of different sizes, and you want to pack them into a rectangle (a box with a length and a width) in a way that they don't overlap with each other.

You want to assign these tasks to the machines in a way that minimizes the total time it takes to complete all the tasks.\n\n**What are the main variables and what do they mean?**\n\n* **Machines**: These are the devices that will perform the tasks.\n* **Jobs**: These are groups of tasks that need to be completed.\n* **Tasks**: These are the individual activities that need to be performed.\n* **Optional tasks**: These are tasks that may or may not be completed.\n* **Start time**: This is the time when a task starts.\n* **Duration**: This is the time it takes to complete a task.\n* **b**: This is a variable that indicates whether an optional task is executed or not.\n\n**What are the basic restrictions or rules of the problem?**\n\n* Each task must be assigned to a machine.\n* A task cannot start before the previous task in the same job is completed.\n* The duration of a task must be within a certain range.\n* Optional tasks have specific durations and may or may not be executed.\n* The total time it takes to complete all tasks on a machine cannot exceed a certain limit.\n\n**What is the goal of the problem?**\nThe goal is to minimize the expected total time it takes to complete all tasks, considering the uncertainty in the task durations.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The Stochastic General Assignment Problem.\n\nThis problem is about assigning tasks to machines and scheduling them to minimize the expected makespan. The problem has two stages: in the first stage, tasks are assigned to machines, and in the second stage, the tasks are scheduled on the machines based on observed processing times.\n\nThe main decision variables are:\n\n* `start`: the start time of each task on each machine in each scenario\n* `dur`: the duration of each task on each machine in each scenario\n* `b`: a boolean variable indicating whether an optional task is executed or not\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* Precedence relations: each task must start after its predecessor has finished\n* Duration constraints: the duration of each task is determined by the observed processing time\n* Optional tasks' constraints: each optional task can be executed at most once, and if it is executed, its duration is fixed\n* Resource constraints: the total processing time of all tasks on each machine cannot exceed the machine's capacity\n\nThe objective is to minimize the expected makespan, which is the maximum completion time of all tasks across all scenarios.\n\nIn essence, this problem is about finding the best assignment and scheduling of tasks to machines to minimize the overall processing time, while taking into account the uncertainty in processing times and the availability of optional tasks.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3045, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "014d2855-5378-4e2e-8fe2-a2869d7061ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "014d2855-5378-4e2e-8fe2-a2869d7061ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "submultisetsum", "source_code": "% subsetsum problem\narray[int] of int: number;\nint: target;\n\nset of int: NUMBER = index_set(number);\nvar set of NUMBER: selected;\n\nconstraint sum(i in selected)\n              (number[i]) = target;\nsolve satisfy;\n\noutput [show(selected)];"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "submultisetsum_beginner_medium", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "submultisetsum", "source_code": "% subsetsum problem\narray[int] of int: number;\nint: target;\n\nset of int: NUMBER = index_set(number);\nvar set of NUMBER: selected;\n\nconstraint sum(i in selected)\n              (number[i]) = target;\nsolve satisfy;\n\noutput [show(selected)];"}, "hash": "03faa1f83bf88a422f033ba2e027e7390bef21394052f3c13631cbf33be3eedf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **The Subset Sum Problem**\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:**\nImagine you have a set of items, each with a specific weight or value.

In other words, we want to find a way to seat the couples together at tables with the lowest possible table numbers.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The Social Golfer Problem.\n\nThis problem is about assigning golfers to tables for a social golfing event. The goal is to seat golfers in a way that maximizes social interaction while respecting certain constraints.\n\nThe main decision variables are:\n\n* `table`: a 2D array that represents the assignment of golfers to tables. Each element `table[t]` is a set of golfers assigned to table `t`.\n* `seat`: a 1D array that represents the assignment of golfers to tables. Each element `seat[p]` is the table number assigned to golfer `p`.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* Each table can have at most `S` golfers.\n* Each golfer must be assigned to exactly one table.\n* Couples (defined in the `couples` array) must not be seated at the same table.\n* Golfers in the `key` set must not be seated at the same table.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the sum of table numbers assigned to couples. In other words, the goal is to seat couples at tables with the lowest possible numbers, while respecting the constraints.\n\nThe problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem, and the Minizinc models provided use a combination of set variables, array variables, and constraints to model the problem. The `not_same_table` predicate is used to ensure that couples and golfers in the `key` set are not seated at the same table. The `global_cardinality_low_up` constraint is used to ensure that each table has at most `S` golfers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2701, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ee61c4f-849f-4111-aa0f-ad65fa5fc067": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ee61c4f-849f-4111-aa0f-ad65fa5fc067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "teamselect", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\n\n\nset of int: PLAYER = 1..11;\nset of int: GOALIE = 1..2;\nset of int: DEFENCE = 3..6;\nset of int: OFFENCE = 7..11;\n\nvar set of PLAYER: Xavier;\nvar set of PLAYER: Yuri;\nvar set of PLAYER: Zena;\n\narray[CAPTAIN] of var set of PLAYER: team = [Xavier,Yuri,Zena];\n\nset of int: CAPTAIN = 1..3;\narray[CAPTAIN,PLAYER] of int: value;\n \nvalue = [| 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 5, 8, 7, 7, 4, 6\n         | 9, 8, 4, 7, 6, 4, 5, 3, 5, 5, 7\n         | 8, 4, 3, 3, 6, 2, 5, 5, 3, 2, 5 |];

The junction has eight traffic lights: four for vehicles and four for pedestrians. Each traffic light can be in one of four states: red, red-yellow, green, or yellow.\n\nThe main decision variables are:\n\n* V1 to V4, which represent the states of the traffic lights for vehicles\n* P1 to P4, which represent the states of the traffic lights for pedestrians\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* At any given time, the traffic lights for vehicles and pedestrians at adjacent roads must be in a safe and compatible state. For example, if the traffic light for vehicles on one road is green, the traffic light for pedestrians on the adjacent road must be red.\n* The traffic lights must follow a specific sequence to ensure smooth traffic flow.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible schedule for the traffic lights that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIn this model, the constraints are represented using quaternary constraints, which specify the allowed combinations of states for the traffic lights at adjacent roads. The model uses a table constraint to enforce these quaternary constraints.

The company needs to decide which warehouses to build and which stores each warehouse should supply to minimize the total cost.\n\nThe main variables are:\n\n* Warehouses: These are the places where the company will store goods.\n* Stores: These are the places where the company will send goods from the warehouses.\n* Capacity: This is the number of stores that each warehouse can supply.\n* Cost: This is the cost of building a warehouse and transporting goods from the warehouse to the stores.\n\nThe basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:\n\n* Each warehouse can only supply a certain number of stores based on its capacity.\n* Each store must be supplied by only one warehouse.\n* The company wants to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of building warehouses and transporting goods.\n\nThe goal of the problem is to find the best way to allocate warehouses to stores to minimize the total cost.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    **Warehouse Allocation Problem**\n\nThe Warehouse Allocation Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves determining the optimal allocation of warehouses to supply stores with goods.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n\n* `supplier`: an array of variables that represents which warehouse supplies each store.\n* `open`: an array of boolean variables that indicates whether each warehouse is constructed or not.\n* `cost`: an array of variables that represents the transportation cost from each warehouse to each store.\n* `tot`: a variable that represents the total cost (construction cost plus transportation cost).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n* Each store must be supplied by exactly one warehouse.\n* The total capacity of the open warehouses must be sufficient to supply all stores.\n* The transportation cost from each warehouse to each store is determined by the cost matrix.\n* The construction cost of each warehouse is fixed and must be paid if the warehouse is open.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the construction costs of the open warehouses and the transportation costs from the warehouses to the stores.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

of the problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Water Buckets Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three buckets of different sizes (8, 5, and 3 pints) and you want to divide a certain amount of water between them in a specific way. You can pour water from one bucket to another, but you want to do it in the fewest number of steps possible.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `state`: an array that represents the amount of water in each bucket at each step\n* `goal_step`: the number of steps it takes to reach the desired goal\n* `buckets`: the three buckets of different sizes\n* `capacity`: the maximum amount of water each bucket can hold\n* `start` and `goal`: the initial and desired amounts of water in each bucket\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* The total amount of water remains the same at each step\n* The amount of water in each bucket can only change by pouring water from one bucket to another\n* After each step, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full\n* The goal is to reach the desired amounts of water in each bucket in the fewest number of steps possible\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Minimize the number of steps (`goal_step`) it takes to reach the desired goal.\n\nNote that Model 2 appears to be a different problem, but it's actually a reformulation of the same Water Buckets Problem using a different modeling approach.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is known as the Water Buckets Problem.\n\nThis problem is about dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a desired distribution of water in the buckets.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of the buckets at each time step, represented by the `state` array in the model. Each element of the array represents the amount of water in a particular bucket at a particular time step.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* The initial state of the buckets is specified by the `start` array.\n* The goal state of the buckets is specified by the `goal` array.\n* At each time step, the amount of water in each bucket must be within its capacity.\n* The total amount of water remains constant throughout the process.\n* At each step, exactly two buckets change their water levels.\n* After each transfer, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the number of transfers required to reach the goal state from the initial state.\n\nIn the second model, the problem is represented as a finite state machine, where the states are the possible configurations of the buckets, and the transitions between states are the pouring operations. The goal is to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3082, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"all_interval_beginner_medium": {"node_ids": ["057f2cef-dc22-432d-967c-1788ede27f05"], "metadata": {"model_name": "all_interval", "source_code": "Model 1 : \n\n\n%\n% All interval problem in MiniZinc\n%\n% \"\"\"\n% Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c%, d, ...), represented by\n% numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly\n% once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover\n% the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major\n% seventh (11 semitones).

This means that the goal is to\n% minimise the number of shifts.\n%\n% The problems come from four different bus companies:\n% Reading (r1 to r5a),\n% CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2),\n% the former London Transport (t1 and t2).\n%\n% The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and\n% short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features). Note\n% that r1 and r1a are the same problem, but have different numbers of\n% generated shifts. Similarly with the problems: c1, c1a and r5, r5a.\n%\n% Problems are presented in the same format as the set partitioning\n% examples in ORLIB. The first line gives the number of rows (pieces of work),\n% columns (shifts) and the minimum number of columns need for a partition.\n% Then each line after that corresponds to one column. It starts with\n% the cost (which is always 1 in our case) then the number of rows it\n% covers, followed by the rows it covers.\n% \"\"\"\n\n\ninclude \"globals.mzn\"; \nint: num_work;\nint: num_shifts;\nint: min_num_shifts;\narray[1..num_shifts] of set of int: shifts;\n\narray[1..num_shifts] of var 0..1: x;\nvar 0..num_shifts: tot_shifts;\n\n% solve minimize tot_shifts;\nsolve :: int_search(\n        x ++ [tot_shifts], \n        first_fail, \n        indomain_min, \n        complete) \n    minimize tot_shifts;\n    % satisfy;\n\nconstraint\n   tot_shifts = sum(x)\n   /\\\n   forall(j in 0..num_work-1) (\n       sum(i in 1..num_shifts) (x[i]*bool2int(j in shifts[i])) = 1\n   )\n   /\\\n   tot_shifts >= min_num_shifts\n\n   % /\\ % for solve satisfy (t1)\n   % tot_shifts = 7\n;\n\n\noutput [\n  \"tot_shifts: \" ++ show(tot_shifts) ++ \"\\n\" ++ \n  \"x: \" ++ show(x) ++ \"\\n\"\n] ++ \n[\n  if fix(x[i]) = 1 then show(shifts[i]) else \"\" endif\n  | i in 1..num_shifts\n] ++ \n[\"\\n\"] ++\n[\n  if fix(x[i]) = 1 then show(i) ++ \" \" else \"\" endif\n  | i in 1..num_shifts\n] ++ [\"\\n\"];\n"}}, "car_beginner_medium": {"node_ids": ["c4e7064d-b240-438a-94bf-c675bbd31424"], "metadata": {"model_name": "car", "source_code": "%\n% Car sequencing in MiniZinc.\n% include \"globals.mzn\";\n\nint: numclasses;\nint: numoptions;\nint: numcars;\nset of int: Classes = 1..numclasses;\nset of int: Options = 1..numoptions;\nset of int: Slots = 1..numcars;\n\narray[Classes] of int: numberPerClass;\n\narray[Classes,Options] of int: optionsRequired;\narray[Options] of int: windowSize;\narray[Options] of int: optMax;\n\narray[Options] of int: optionNumberPerClass = [sum(j in Classes) (numberPerClass[j] * optionsRequired[j,i]) | i in Options];\n\n% decision variables\n\narray[Slots] of var Classes: slot;\narray[Options, Slots] of var 0..1: setup;\n\n\nvar int: z = sum(s in Classes) (s*slot[s]);\n\n% solve minimize z;\nsolve :: int_search(slot, input_order, indomain_min, complete)\n  satisfy;\n\nconstraint\n  forall(c in Classes ) (\n    sum(s in Slots ) (bool2int(slot[s] = c)) = numberPerClass[c]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, s in 1..numcars - windowSize[o] + 1) (\n    sum(j in s..s + windowSize[o]- 1) (setup[o,j]) <= optMax[o]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, s in Slots ) (\n    setup[o,s] = optionsRequired[slot[s],o]\n  )\n  /\\\n  forall(o in Options, i in 1..optionNumberPerClass[o]) (\n    sum(s in 1..(numcars - i * windowSize[o])) (setup[o,s]) >=\n           (optionNumberPerClass[o] - i * optMax[o])\n  )\n;\n\n% for solve satisfy\n% constraint z = 82;\n\n\noutput [\n \"z: \" ++ show(z) ++ \"\\n\" ++\n \"slot: \" ++ show(slot) ++ \"\\n\"\n] ++\n[\n  if j = 1 then \"\\n\" else \" \" endif ++ \n    show(setup[i,j])\n  | i in Options, j in Slots\n];\n"}}, "carpet_cutting_beginner_medium": {"node_ids": ["89cd153a-1b4d-4d5b-af2c-e77950af51a5"], "metadata": {"model_name": "carpet_cutting", "source_code": "Model 1 :\n\nint: n;
