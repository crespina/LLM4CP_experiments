pitch-classes (c, c%, d, ...), represented by\n% numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly\n% once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover\n% the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major\n% seventh (11 semitones). That is, for each of the intervals, there is a\n% pair of neigbhouring pitch-classes in the series, between which this\n% interval appears. The problem of finding such a series can be easily\n% formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem on Z_n,\n% the set of integer residues modulo n. Given n in N, find a vector\n% s = (s_1, ..., s_n), such that (i) s is a permutation of\n% Z_n = {0,1,...,n-1}; and (ii) the interval vector\n% v = (|s_2-s_1|, |s_3-s_2|, ... |s_n-s_{n-1}|) is a permutation of\n% Z_n-{0} = {1,2,...,n-1}. A vector v satisfying these conditions is\n% called an all-interval series of size n; the problem of finding such\n% a series is the all-interval series problem of size n. We may also be\n% interested in finding all possible series of a given size.\n\ninclude \"globals.mzn\";\n\nint: n = 12;\n% array[1..n] of var 1..n: x;\narray[1..n] of var 1..n: x;\narray[1..n-1] of var 1..n-1: diffs;\nint: sum_distinct = ((n+1)*n) div 2;\n\n% max_regret seems to be quite good....\nsolve :: int_search(x, max_regret, indomain_split, complete) satisfy;\n\nconstraint      \n  all_different(diffs) :: domain\n  /\\  \n  all_different(x) :: domain\n  /\\ \n  forall(k in 1..n-1) (\n      diffs[k] = abs(x[k+1] -

You want to arrange these notes in a special order so that each note appears only once, and the distance between each pair of adjacent notes is different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes. For example, if the distance between the first two notes is 2 semitones, then there should be no other pair of adjacent notes with a distance of 2 semitones.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `x` or `series`: an array of 12 variables, each representing a musical note (0 to 11). This array represents the order in which the notes will be played.\n* `diffs` or `differences`: an array of variables representing the distance between each pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each note must appear only once in the series.\n* The distance between each pair of adjacent notes must be different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Find an arrangement of the 12 notes that satisfies the above rules.\n\nNote that the different models provided are different ways of solving the same problem, but the underlying problem remains the same.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: All-Interval Series Problem\n\ndescription: The All-Interval Series Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming that involves finding a series of pitch classes such that each pitch class occurs exactly once and the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\n\nvariables: x = (x_1, ..., x_n) where x_i \u2208 {0, ..., n-1} for i = 1, ..., n; diffs = (diffs_1, ..., diffs_{n-1}) where diffs_i \u2208 {1, ..., n-1} for i = 1, ..., n-1\n\nThe variables x represent the pitch classes in the series, and the variables diffs represent the intervals between neighboring notes.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different(x) \u2227 all_different(diffs) \u2227 \n\u2200k \u2208 {1, ..., n-1} (diffs_k = |x_{k+1} - x_k|) \u2227 \nx_1 < x_{n-1} \u2227 diffs_1 < diffs_2\n\nThe constraints ensure that each pitch class occurs exactly once, each interval occurs exactly once, the intervals are calculated correctly, and some symmetry-breaking constraints are added to reduce the search space.\n\nobjective: The problem is a satisfaction problem, meaning that the goal is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 9587, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbcc826d-5e58-4d97-a3f3-cd6ca7cc5b24": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbcc826d-5e58-4d97-a3f3-cd6ca7cc5b24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "assign"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "assign_beginner_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "assign"}, "hash": "671bc89c939d03e9f302acfc8f94b5682d07e6d202921228d5c373292a8db3d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n                    ------\n                    Model 1 :\n\nint: n;\nset of int: WORK = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: TASK = 1..m;\narray[WORK,TASK] of int: profit;\narray[WORK] of var TASK: x;\n% new\narray[WORK] of var int: px =\n     [ profit[w,x[w]] | w in WORK ];\nvar int: obj = sum(w in WORK)(px[w]);\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(x);\n\nann: varselect;\nann: valselect;\n\nsolve :: int_search(px, varselect, valselect, complete)\n      maximize obj;\n\noutput [\"obj = \\(obj); x = \\(x);\\n\"];\n\n\nvarselect = largest;\nvalselect = indomain_min;\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[DOM] of var COD: task;\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"inverse.mzn\";\nconstraint inverse(task,worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(w in COD)\n            (profit[w,task[w]]);\n\noutput [show(task)];\n\n\n\nModel 3 : \n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(t in COD)\n            (profit[worker[t],t]);\n\noutput [show(worker)];\n\n                    ======\n                    Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **The Assignment Problem**\n\n**What is it about?**\nImagine you have a group of workers and a list of tasks that need to be done.

To simplify the problem we have\n% made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to\n% minimise the number of shifts.\n%\n% The problems come from four different bus companies:\n% Reading (r1 to r5a),\n% CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2),\n% the former London Transport (t1 and t2).\n%\n% The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and\n% short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features).

The clues are given in the form of arithmetic operations and comparisons involving the numbers in the grid.\n\nvariables: M[i,j] (i, j = 1..9), A1, A4, ..., A30, D1, D2, ..., D28\n\nThe variables M[i,j] represent the numbers in the 9x9 grid. The variables A1, A4, ..., A30 and D1, D2, ..., D28 represent the numerical answers to the clues, which are placed horizontally (Across) and vertically (Down) in the grid, respectively.\n\nconstraints: \nacross(M, A1, 4, 1, 1) /\\ ... /\\ down(M, D28, 2, 8, 8) /\\ \nA1 = 2 * A27 /\\ ... /\\ D28 = D21 + 27 /\\ \nM[1,5] = 0 /\\ ... /\\ M[9,5] = 0\n\nThe constraints can be divided into three categories: \n1. The across and down predicates, which ensure that the numbers in the grid are correctly placed to form the numerical answers to the clues.\n2. The clue constraints, which define the relationships between the numerical answers, such as arithmetic operations and comparisons.\n3. The blackbox constraints, which fix certain cells in the grid to be zero.\n\nobjective: The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, i.e., to fill the grid with numbers such that all the clues are satisfied.

The second constraint links the x and y variables. The third constraint ensures that the Langford's condition is satisfied, i.e., any two consecutive copies of digit k are separated by k other digits. The fourth constraint ensures that all digits in the sequence are distinct.

In the case of the magic sequence, it's a sequence of numbers where each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself. For example, if the sequence has a 6, it means the number 6 appears 6 times in the sequence.

The value of `grid[r,c]` is 0 if the cell at row `r` and column `c` is dead, and 1 if it is live.\n\nconstraints: \n`grid[0,x] = 0 /\\ grid[1,x] = 0 /\\ grid[size+2,x] = 0 /\\ grid[size+3,x] = 0 /\\ grid[x,0] == 0 /\\ grid[x,1] == 0 /\\ grid[x,size+2] = 0 /\\ grid[x,size+3] = 0` for `x in augmentedBoardCoord`\n`((grid[r-1,c-1] + grid[r-1,c] + grid[r-1,c+1] + grid[r,c-1] + grid[r,c+1] + grid[r+1,c-1] + grid[r+1,c] + grid[r+1,c+1] ) = 3) -> (grid[r,c] = 1)` for `r, c in checkConstraintsBoardCoord`\n`(grid[r,c] = 1) -> (2 <= (grid[r-1,c-1] + grid[r-1,c] + grid[r-1,c+1] + grid[r,c-1] + grid[r,c+1] + grid[r+1,c-1] + grid[r+1,c] + grid[r+1,c+1] ) <= 3)` for `r, c in checkConstraintsBoardCoord`\n`grid[2,2] >= grid[size+1,size+1] /\\ grid[2,size+1] >= grid[size+1,2]`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the pattern is stable and follows the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The first constraint sets the boundary cells to be dead. The second constraint ensures that each cell with exactly three live neighbors is alive. The third constraint ensures that each live cell has two or three live neighbors. The last constraint is a symmetry-breaking constraint, which forces the assignment to respect an ordering on the values that occur in corner entries of the board.\n\nobjective: Maximize `z = sum(r in objFunctionBoardCoord, c in objFunctionBoardCoord) (grid[r,c])`\n\nThe objective is to maximize the number of live cells in the grid, which is represented by the variable `z`.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 6593, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5e4f0bc-ee5e-4fea-9927-b83984dc179e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5e4f0bc-ee5e-4fea-9927-b83984dc179e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "mip"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "mip_beginner_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "mip"}, "hash": "91bf346a4f0c5a28ef30189ece5856cf343881be1a489350c31a249097292643", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n                    ------\n                    Model 1 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.0*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\n\nsolve maximize 1.0*B - 1.0*C + 1.0*D;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 1.0*C + 2.0*D <=  4.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 3.0*C + 1.0*D <= -5.0;\nconstraint -1.0*B + 1.0*C - 2.0*D <= -1.0;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 3 :\n\n\nvar int: B;\nvar int: C;\nvar int: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.5*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 4 :\n\n\nsolve maximize 21*x + 11*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint 7*x + 4*y <= 13;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n\n\n\nModel 5 : \n\n\nsolve maximize 8*x + 5*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint x + y <= 6;\nconstraint 9*x + 5*y <= 45;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n\n                    ======\n                    Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **Problem Name:** Resource Allocation Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three types of resources (let's call them B, C, and D) and you want to allocate them in the best way possible to maximize your profit or benefit.

Quasigroup existence problem\n\n**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a table with numbers from 1 to n, where n is a given number. You need to fill this table in a special way, so that each row and each column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, there are some rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `quasiGroup`: a table (or matrix) with numbers from 1 to n, where each row and column contains each number exactly once.\n* `qgDiagonal`: a list of numbers that represents the diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each row and each column of the `quasiGroup` table should contain each number exactly once.\n* There are some specific rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table should also satisfy some specific rules.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a `quasiGroup` table that satisfies all the rules and restrictions.\n\nNote that the problem is about finding a specific type of mathematical structure called a quasigroup, which is a set with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties. The problem is to find a quasigroup of a given order (i.e., with a given number of elements).\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Quasigroup Existence Problem\n\ndescription: The Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics, which involves finding a multiplication table of size n x n, where each element is an integer from 1 to n, such that each row and column contains each element exactly once, and certain multiplication axioms hold.\n\nvariables: quasiGroup[row, col], qgDiagonal[i]\n\nThe decision variables are a 2D array quasiGroup, where quasiGroup[row, col] represents the element at row and column in the multiplication table, and a 1D array qgDiagonal, where qgDiagonal[i] represents the diagonal element at position i.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | col in nDomain]) /\\ \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | row in nDomain]) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,i] = i /\\ \nquasiGroup[quasiGroup[j,i],quasiGroup[i,j]] = i /\\ \nall_different(qgDiagonal) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i] /\\ \n(quasiGroup[i,i]=j) -> (quasiGroup[j,j]=i) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,n-1] + 2 >= i\n\nThe constraints ensure that:\n- Each row and column contains each element exactly once.\n- The diagonal elements are equal to their indices.\n- The multiplication axiom (b*a)*b = a*(b*a) holds.\n- The diagonal elements are all different.\n- The table is anti-Abelian, i.e., quasiGroup[i,j] is not equal to quasiGroup[j,i] for i != j.\n- If (i*i)=j then (j*j) = i.\n- Symmetry-breaking constraints to reduce the search space.\n\nobjective: The problem is a satisfaction problem, i.e., it does not have an objective function to minimize or maximize.

So all the '1's in the matrix 'rings' stand for an ADM.\n% Hence the objective is to minimise the sum over all columns and rows of matrix\n% 'rings'.\n% \"\"\"\n\nint: r;  % upper bound for amount of rings\nint: n;  % amount of clients\n\n\n% original comment: \n% we have double entries here because of the symmetric structure!\narray[1..n, 1..n] of 0..1: demand;\narray[1..r] of 1..n: capacity_nodes;\n\narray[1..r, 1..n] of var 0..1: rings;\nvar int: z =  sum(ring in 1..r, client in 1..n) (rings[ring, client]);\n\nsolve minimize z;\n% solve satisfy;\n\n\nconstraint\n%   z <= 7 % for solve satisfy\n%   /\\\n\n   % original comment:\n   % if there is a demand between 2 nodes, then there has to exist \n   % a ring, on which they are both installed\n   forall(client1,client2 in 1..n where client1 < client2) (\n      (demand[client1,client2] = 1) ->\n           exists(ring in 1..r) (\n                 rings[ring,client1] + rings[ring, client2] >= 2\n           )\n   )   \n   /\\\n   % original comment:\n   % capacity of each ring must not be exceeded     \n   forall(ring in 1..r) (\n        sum(client in 1..n) (\n              rings[ring, client]\n              ) <= capacity_nodes[ring] \n   )\n;\n\n\n%\n% data\n% (sonet_problem1nu.param)\n%\nr = 4;\nn = 5;\n\ndemand =\narray2d(1..n, 1..n,\n        [0,1,0,1,0,\n         1,0,1,0,0,\n         0,1,0,0,1,\n         1,0,0,0,0,\n         0,0,1,0,0])\n;\n\ncapacity_nodes = [3,2,2,1];\n\n\noutput \n[\n  \"z: \", show(z)\n] ++\n[\n  if client = 1 then \"\\n\" else \" \" endif ++\n    show(rings[ring, client])\n  | ring in 1..r, client in 1..n\n] ++ [\"\\n\"];\n\n                    ======\n                    Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    SONET Problem\n\nThe SONET problem is about designing a network that connects certain nodes (think of them as computers or devices) in a way that uses the fewest resources possible.\n\nThe main variables are:\n\n* Rings: These are like circles that connect nodes together.

can contain 5 and 3 pints respectively, the problem requires to divide the water into two by pouring water between buckets (that is, to end up with 4 pints in the 8 pint bucket, and 4 pints in the 5 pint bucket) in the smallest number of transfers.\n%\n% The generalization consists in making the specification parametric with respect to the start and goal configurations, which are now inputs to the problem.\n%\n% Problem input\n%\n% * Function start, assigning an initial amount of water to each bucket\n% * Function goal, assigning the goal amount of water to each bucket \n%\n% Search

             Here is the explanation of the problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Water Buckets Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three buckets of different sizes (8, 5, and 3 pints) and you want to divide a certain amount of water between them in a specific way. You can pour water from one bucket to another, but you want to do it in the fewest number of steps possible.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `state`: an array that represents the amount of water in each bucket at each step\n* `goal_step`: the number of steps it takes to reach the desired goal\n* `buckets`: the three buckets of different sizes\n* `capacity`: the maximum amount of water each bucket can hold\n* `start` and `goal`: the initial and desired amounts of water in each bucket\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* The total amount of water remains the same at each step\n* The amount of water in each bucket can only change by pouring water from one bucket to another\n* After each step, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full\n* The goal is to reach the desired amounts of water in each bucket in the fewest number of steps possible\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Minimize the number of steps (`goal_step`) it takes to reach the desired goal.\n\nNote that Model 2 appears to be a different problem, but it's actually a reformulation of the same Water Buckets Problem using a different modeling approach.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Water Buckets Problem\n\ndescription: The Water Buckets Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming. It involves dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a specific goal configuration of water in the buckets.\n\nvariables: `state[steps, buckets]`, `goal_step`\n\nThe decision variables are `state[steps, buckets]`, which represents the amount of water in each bucket at each time step, and `goal_step`, which represents the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.\n\nconstraints: \n`start[b] <= capacity[b]`, `goal[b] <= capacity[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(start[b]) = sum(b in buckets)(goal[b])`, \n`state[1,b]=start[b]`, `state[goal_step,b] = goal[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(bool2int(state[step,b] != state[step+1, b])) = 2`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(state[step,b]) = sum(b in buckets)(state[step+1,b])`, \n`((state[step, b1] != state[step+1, b1]) /\\ (state[step, b2] != state[step, b2])) -> (state[step+1,b1] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b1] = capacity[b1] \\/ state[step+1,b2] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b2] = capacity[b2])`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the initial and goal configurations are within the capacity of the buckets, the total amount of water is conserved, the initial and goal configurations are reached, exactly two buckets change in each step, the total amount of water is conserved in each step, and the pouring operation is valid (i.e., the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full).\n\nobjective: `minimize goal_step`\n\nThe objective is to minimize the number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 9562, "text_template":
