standard pitch-classes (c, c%, d, ...), represented by\n% numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly\n% once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover\n% the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major\n% seventh (11 semitones). That is, for each of the intervals, there is a\n% pair of neigbhouring pitch-classes in the series, between which this\n% interval appears. The problem of finding such a series can be easily\n% formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem on Z_n,\n% the set of integer residues modulo n. Given n in N, find a vector\n% s = (s_1, ..., s_n), such that (i) s is a permutation of\n% Z_n = {0,1,...,n-1}; and (ii) the interval vector\n% v = (|s_2-s_1|, |s_3-s_2|, ... |s_n-s_{n-1}|) is a permutation of\n% Z_n-{0} = {1,2,...,n-1}. A vector v satisfying these conditions is\n% called an all-interval series of size n; the problem of finding such\n% a series is the all-interval series problem of size n. We may also be\n% interested in finding all possible series of a given size.\n\ninclude \"globals.mzn\";\n\nint: n = 12;\n% array[1..n] of var 1..n: x;\narray[1..n] of var 1..n: x;\narray[1..n-1] of var 1..n-1: diffs;\nint: sum_distinct = ((n+1)*n) div 2;\n\n% max_regret seems to be quite good....\nsolve :: int_search(x, max_regret, indomain_split, complete) satisfy;\n\nconstraint      \n  all_different(diffs) :: domain\n  /\\  \n  all_different(x) :: domain\n  /\\ \n  forall(k in 1..n-1) (\n      diffs[k] = abs(x[k+1] -

You want to arrange these notes in a special order so that each note appears only once, and the distance between each pair of adjacent notes is different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes. For example, if the distance between the first two notes is 2 semitones, then there should be no other pair of adjacent notes with a distance of 2 semitones.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `x` or `series`: an array of 12 variables, each representing a musical note (0 to 11). This array represents the order in which the notes will be played.\n* `diffs` or `differences`: an array of variables representing the distance between each pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each note must appear only once in the series.\n* The distance between each pair of adjacent notes must be different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Find an arrangement of the 12 notes that satisfies the above rules.\n\nNote that the different models provided are different ways of solving the same problem, but the underlying problem remains the same.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is the All-Interval Series Problem.\n\nThe All-Interval Series Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves finding a series of pitch classes (represented by numbers 0 to 11) such that each pitch class occurs exactly once, and the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the pitch classes, represented by an array `x` or `series` in the models, which is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each pitch class occurs exactly once (i.e., the array `x` or `series` is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11).\n* The differences between neighboring notes are all different (i.e., the intervals between consecutive pitch classes are all unique).\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a series that satisfies these constraints.\n\nNote that there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize in this problem. The goal is to find a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: All-Interval Series Problem\n\ndescription: The All-Interval Series Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming that involves finding a series of pitch classes such that each pitch class occurs exactly once and the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\n\nvariables: x = (x_1, ..., x_n) where x_i \u2208 {0, ..., n-1} for i = 1, ..., n; diffs = (diffs_1, ..., diffs_{n-1}) where diffs_i \u2208 {1, ..., n-1} for i = 1, ..., n-1\n\nThe variables x represent the pitch classes in the series, and the variables diffs represent the intervals between neighboring notes.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different(x) \u2227 all_different(diffs) \u2227 \n\u2200k \u2208 {1, ..., n-1} (diffs_k = |x_{k+1} - x_k|) \u2227 \nx_1 < x_{n-1} \u2227 diffs_1 < diffs_2\n\nThe constraints ensure that each pitch class occurs exactly once, each interval occurs exactly once, the intervals are calculated correctly, and some symmetry-breaking constraints are added to reduce the search space.\n\nobjective: The problem is a satisfaction problem, meaning that the goal is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 10845, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe7891a3-3d4a-4c7e-96ab-b58a5f0e5816": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe7891a3-3d4a-4c7e-96ab-b58a5f0e5816", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "assign"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "assign_beginner_medium_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "assign"}, "hash": "3904bddb6bbc3dc64bccf0abd5fadb51b41c77d27b8ad1482c736cffd4f94209", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n                    ------\n                    Model 1 :\n\nint: n;\nset of int: WORK = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: TASK = 1..m;\narray[WORK,TASK] of int: profit;\narray[WORK] of var TASK: x;\n% new\narray[WORK] of var int: px =\n     [ profit[w,x[w]] | w in WORK ];\nvar int: obj = sum(w in WORK)(px[w]);\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(x);\n\nann: varselect;\nann: valselect;\n\nsolve :: int_search(px, varselect, valselect, complete)\n      maximize obj;\n\noutput [\"obj = \\(obj); x = \\(x);\\n\"];\n\n\nvarselect = largest;\nvalselect = indomain_min;\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[DOM] of var COD: task;\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"inverse.mzn\";\nconstraint inverse(task,worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(w in COD)\n            (profit[w,task[w]]);\n\noutput [show(task)];\n\n\n\nModel 3 : \n\nint: n;\nset of int: DOM = 1..n;\nint: m;\nset of int: COD = 1..m;\narray[DOM,COD] of int: profit;\n\narray[COD] of var DOM: worker;\n\ninclude \"alldifferent.mzn\";\nconstraint alldifferent(worker);\n\n\nsolve maximize sum(t in COD)\n            (profit[worker[t],t]);\n\noutput [show(worker)];\n\n                    ======\n                    Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **The Assignment Problem**\n\n**What is it about?**\nImagine you have a group of workers and a list of tasks that need to be done. Each worker can do one task, and each task can be done by one worker. The problem is to assign each worker to a task in a way that maximizes the total profit or benefit.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `WORK` (or `DOM`): a set of workers\n* `TASK` (or `COD`): a set of tasks\n* `x` (or `task` or `worker`): a variable that represents the assignment of a worker to a task\n* `profit`: a table that shows the profit or benefit of assigning a worker to a task\n* `obj`: the total profit or benefit of the assignment\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each worker can do only one task.\n* Each task can be done by only one worker.\n* The assignment must be done in a way that maximizes the total profit or benefit.\n\n**Goal:**\nThe goal is to find an assignment of workers to tasks that maximizes the total profit or benefit.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is the **Assignment Problem**.\n\nThe Assignment Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves assigning a set of tasks to a set of workers in such a way that each task is assigned to exactly one worker and each worker is assigned to exactly one task. The goal is to maximize the total profit or value obtained from the assignments.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are:\n\n* `x` or `task` or `worker`: These variables represent the assignment of tasks to workers. For example, `x[w]` represents the task assigned to worker `w`.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each task is assigned to exactly one worker.\n* Each worker is assigned to exactly one task.\n* The assignments must be unique, meaning that no two workers can be assigned the same task, and no two tasks can be assigned to the same worker.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to maximize the total profit obtained from the assignments. The profit is calculated as the sum of the profits obtained from each task-worker pair.\n\nIn the provided models, the profit is represented by the `profit` array, where `profit[w,t]` represents the profit obtained from assigning task `t` to worker `w`. The objective is to maximize the sum of these profits.\n\nThe models use different constraints and search strategies to solve the problem. Model 1 uses the `alldifferent` constraint to ensure that the assignments are unique, while Model 2 uses the `inverse` constraint to achieve the same goal. Model 3 is similar to Model 1 but uses a different search strategy.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Assignment Problem\n\ndescription: The Assignment Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and operations research.

The `solve` statement uses a boolean search strategy to find a solution, and the `output` statement is used to print the solution in a human-readable format.\n\nNote that the model also includes some symmetry-breaking constraints to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of the solver. These constraints ensure that the solution is lexicographically smaller than any other possible solution, which helps to avoid duplicate solutions.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)\n\ndescription: A Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) is a combinatorial design in which a set of v elements is divided into b blocks, each of size k, such that each element occurs in r blocks, and every pair of elements occurs together in \u03bb blocks.

These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of\n% work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift\n% covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost. We must select\n% a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and\n% only once: this is called a partition. Further,\n%\n% In the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is\n% to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the\n% total cost of the partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have\n% made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to\n% minimise the number of shifts.\n%\n% The problems come from four different bus companies:\n% Reading (r1 to r5a),\n% CentreWest Ealing area (c1, c1a, c2),\n% the former London Transport (t1 and t2).\n%\n% The problems have differing regulations and features (e.g. urban and\n% short distance rural bus schedules can have very different features).

Each task has a specific duration and requires a specific machine. The goal is to schedule these tasks in a way that minimizes the total time it takes to complete all the tasks.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `n`: The number of jobs (or tasks) to be performed.\n* `m`: The number of machines in the workshop.\n* `JOB`: A set of integers representing the jobs (1 to `n`).\n* `MACH`: A set of integers representing the machines (1 to `m`).\n* `TASK`: A set of integers representing the tasks (1 to `m`).\n* `d`: An array that stores the duration of each task.\n* `mc`: An array that stores the machine required for each task.\n* `s`: An array of variables that represents the start time of each task.\n* `makespan`: A variable that represents the total time it takes to complete all the tasks.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each task must be performed in a specific order (e.g., task 1 must be completed before task 2).\n* Each machine can only perform one task at a time.\n* The start time of each task must be greater than or equal to the completion time of the previous task.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to minimize the `makespan`, which is the total time it takes to complete all the tasks.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    **Flowshop Scheduling Problem**\n\nThe Flowshop Scheduling Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves scheduling a set of jobs on a set of machines in a specific order.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n\n* `s[j,t]`: the start time of task `t` in job `j`\n* `makespan`: the maximum completion time of all jobs\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n\n* Each task in a job must be performed in order, meaning that the start time of a task must be after the completion time of the previous task in the same job.\n* Only one task can be performed on a machine at a time, meaning that two tasks on the same machine cannot overlap in time.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the `makespan`, which is the maximum completion time of all jobs.\n\nIn summary, the Flowshop Scheduling Problem involves scheduling a set of jobs on a set of machines in a specific order, subject to constraints on the order of tasks within each job and the availability of machines, with the goal of minimizing the overall completion time.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Job Shop Scheduling Problem\n\ndescription: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem is a classic problem in operations research and computer science that involves scheduling a set of jobs on a set of machines.

Additionally, the puzzle is divided into \"cages\" or \"segments\" which are groups of cells that must add up to a specific total value. Each cage must contain each number only once, and no number can be repeated within a cage.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the values of the cells in the 9x9 grid, represented by the `x` array in the model.

Each number should appear m times in the sequence. The rule is that if a number k appears, the next time it appears, it should be k+1 positions later in the sequence.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* n: the highest number in the set (e.g., if n=4, the set is {1, 2, 3, 4})\n* m: how many times each number should appear in the sequence\n* x (or y): the sequence of numbers, where each number is a position in the sequence\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each number from 1 to n should appear m times in the sequence.\n* If a number k appears, the next time it appears, it should be k+1 positions later in the sequence.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a sequence that satisfies the rules above.\n\nNote that the different models are just different ways of representing the same problem, and the explanation above applies to all of them.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    Langford's Problem.\n\nLangford's Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves arranging a sequence of digits in a specific way. The problem is defined as follows: given two positive integers `m` and `n`, create a sequence of `m` copies of the digits from 1 to `n`, such that any two consecutive copies of a digit `k` are separated by exactly `k` other digits.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the positions of the digits in the sequence, represented by the `x` or `y` arrays in the models. These variables represent the indices at which each digit appears in the sequence.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each digit appears exactly `m` times in the sequence.\n* Any two consecutive copies of a digit `k` are separated by exactly `k` other digits.\n* The sequence must contain all digits from 1 to `n` exactly `m` times.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIn simpler terms, the problem is about creating a sequence of digits where each digit appears a certain number of times, and the distance between consecutive appearances of the same digit is equal to the digit's value. For example, if we have two copies of the digits 1 to 4, a valid solution would be `41312432`, where each digit appears twice, and the distance between consecutive appearances of the same digit is equal to the digit's value.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Langford's Problem\n\ndescription: Langford's problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves arranging m copies of digits 1 to n in a sequence such that any two consecutive copies of digit k are separated by k other digits.\n\nvariables: x[d,c], y[p] \nx[d,c] represents the position of the c-th copy of digit d in the sequence, and y[p] represents the digit at position p in the sequence. \n\nconstraints: \nalldifferent([x[d,c] | d in DIG, c in COPY]), \ninverse([x[d,c] | d in DIG, c in COPY], y), \nforall(d in DIG, c in 1..m-1) (x[d,c+1] = x[d,c] + d + 1), \nalldifferent(y), \nforall(d in DIG, c in 1..m-1, p in POS) (y[p] = m*(d-1) + c <-> y[p+d+1] = m*(d-1) + c + 1)\n\nThe first constraint ensures that all positions in the sequence are distinct. The second constraint links the x and y variables. The third constraint ensures that the Langford's condition is satisfied, i.e., any two consecutive copies of digit k are separated by k other digits. The fourth constraint ensures that all digits in the sequence are distinct. The fifth constraint is an alternative way to ensure the Langford's condition.\n\nobjective: satisfy\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 7268, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9c8b2b9-423d-49c6-b149-d5defe4ede9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9c8b2b9-423d-49c6-b149-d5defe4ede9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "loan"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "loan_beginner_medium_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "loan"}, "hash": "5827a440f5b2e9ede836645d2b4cea9948cd83e665e0e46bc441156c8952d516", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n                    ------\n                    % variables\nvar float: R;        % quarterly repayment\nvar float: P;        % principal initially borrowed\nvar 0.0 .. 10.0: I;  % interest rate\n\n% intermediate variables\nvar float: B1; % balance after one quarter\nvar float: B2; % balance after two quarters\nvar float: B3; % balance after three quarters\nvar float: B4; % balance owing at end\n\nconstraint B1 = P * (1.0 + I) - R;\nconstraint B2 = B1 * (1.0 + I) - R;\nconstraint B3 = B2 * (1.0 + I) - R; \nconstraint B4 = B3 * (1.0 + I) - R;\n\nsolve satisfy;\n\noutput [\n \"Borrowing \", show_float(0, 2, P), \" at \", show(I*100.0), \n \"% interest, and repaying \", show_float(0, 2, R), \n  \"\\nper quarter for 1 year leaves \", show_float(0, 2, B4), \" owing\\n\"\n];\n\n\n                    ======\n                    Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    Loan Repayment Problem\n\nThis problem is about borrowing money and paying it back with interest over a year.\n\nThe main variables are:\n- R: the amount of money you pay back each quarter (like a monthly payment, but every 3 months)\n- P: the amount of money you borrow initially\n- I: the interest rate, which is like a fee for borrowing money\n- B1, B2, B3, B4: these are like snapshots of how much you still owe after each quarter\n\nThe basic rules are:\n- You borrow some money (P) and promise to pay it back with some extra (I) as interest.\n- Each quarter, you pay back some money (R), and the amount you still owe changes based on the interest rate.\n\nThe goal of the problem is to find a way to pay back the loan over a year, with the given interest rate, and see how much you still owe at the end.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    Loan Repayment Problem.\n\nThis problem is about finding the optimal loan repayment plan for a borrower who takes out a loan with a certain interest rate and repays it over four quarters.\n\nThe main decision variables are:\n\n* R: the quarterly repayment amount\n* P: the principal amount borrowed\n* I: the interest rate\n\nThese variables represent the key aspects of the loan: how much is borrowed, how much interest is charged, and how much is repaid each quarter.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* The balance after each quarter is calculated by adding the interest accrued and subtracting the repayment made.\n* The balance owing at the end of the four quarters is calculated similarly.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.

There are 19 numbers in total, and they are represented by letters like a, b, c, and so on.\n\nThe basic rules of the problem are:\n\n* Each triangle must have a different number in it.\n* The numbers in each row of triangles must add up to 38.\n* The numbers in each column of triangles must also add up to 38.\n* Some specific triangles have to have smaller numbers than others.\n\nThe goal of the problem is to find a way to arrange the numbers in the triangles so that all the rules are followed.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    **Magic Hexagon Problem**\n\nThe Magic Hexagon problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves arranging numbers in a specific pattern to satisfy certain conditions.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe problem is about creating a hexagonal arrangement of 19 numbers from 1 to 19, such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is equal to 38. The arrangement is subject to certain constraints, making it a challenging problem to solve.\n\n**Decision Variables**\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the 19 variables `a` to `s`, which represent the numbers to be arranged in the hexagonal pattern. These variables are integers between 1 and 19.\n\n**Key Constraints**\n\nThe key constraints in this problem can be described as follows:\n\n* Each number from 1 to 19 must be used exactly once in the arrangement (all_different constraint).\n* The sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal to 38.\n* Certain numbers must be less than or equal to others (e.g., `a` must be less than `c`, `h`, `l`, `q`, and `s`).\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible arrangement of the numbers that satisfies all the constraints. There is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize; the goal is to find a solution that meets all the conditions.\n\nIn summary, the Magic Hexagon problem is a challenging constraint programming problem that requires finding a specific arrangement of numbers to satisfy a set of constraints, with no explicit objective function to optimize.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Magic Hexagon Problem\n\ndescription: The Magic Hexagon Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to find a configuration of numbers in a hexagonal shape such that the sums of numbers along each line and diagonal are equal to a certain value.\n\nvariables: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s \u2208 {1, ..., 19}\n\nThese variables represent the numbers to be placed in the hexagonal shape.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different(LD) \u2227 \na + b + c = 38 \u2227 \nd + e + f + g = 38 \u2227 \nh + i + j + k + l = 38 \u2227 \nm + n + o + p = 38 \u2227 \nq + r + s = 38 \u2227 \na + d + h = 38 \u2227 \nb + e + i + m = 38 \u2227 \nc + f + j + n + q = 38 \u2227 \ng + k + o + r = 38 \u2227 \nl + p + s = 38 \u2227 \nc + g + l = 38 \u2227 \nb + f + k + p = 38 \u2227 \na + e + j + o + s = 38 \u2227 \nd + i + n + r = 38 \u2227 \nh + m + q = 38 \u2227 \na < c \u2227 \na < h \u2227 \na < l \u2227 \na < q \u2227 \na < s \u2227 \nc < h\n\nThese constraints ensure that all numbers are distinct, the sums of numbers along each line and diagonal are equal to 38, and some additional ordering constraints to break symmetry.\n\nobjective: satisfy\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4759, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4461e53b-629f-49a1-b598-999996afc52b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4461e53b-629f-49a1-b598-999996afc52b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "magic_sequence"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "magic_sequence_beginner_medium_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "magic_sequence"}, "hash": "f6edc1dbb606a164cb5fffc1dfbbed7c746d52e44d428d875ca61d90924499e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n                    ------\n                    Model 1 :\n\n% Magic sequence in MiniZinc.\n% A magic sequence of length n is a sequence of integers x0 . . xn-1 between 0 and n-1, such that for all i in 0 to n-1, the number i occurs exactly xi times in the sequence.

In the case of the magic sequence, it's a sequence of numbers where each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself. For example, if the sequence has a 6, it means the number 6 appears 6 times in the sequence. In the case of the magic square, it's an arrangement of numbers in a square grid where each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same total.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `s` or `magic`: an array of variables that represent the magic sequence or square.\n* `n`: the length of the sequence or the size of the square.\n* `total`: the total sum of the numbers in the magic square.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* In the magic sequence, each number appears a certain number of times, and that number is equal to the value of the number itself.\n* In the magic square, each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same total.\n* Each cell in the magic square can only contain one number.\n\n**Goal of the problem:**\n\n* Find a magic sequence or square that satisfies the rules and restrictions.\n* In some cases, the goal is to find all possible solutions or to count the number of solutions.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem represented by these Minizinc models is the Magic Sequence/Magic Square problem.\n\n**Problem Description:**\nA Magic Sequence/Magic Square is an arrangement of integers in a sequence or square grid, such that each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly i times in the sequence, where i is the value of the integer. For example, the sequence 6, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 is a Magic Sequence of length 10, because 0 appears 6 times, 1 appears twice, and 2 appears once.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nThe main decision variables in these models are arrays of integers, representing the Magic Sequence or Magic Square. In the sequence models, the array `s` represents the Magic Sequence, where `s[i]` is the value of the i-th element in the sequence. In the square models, the array `magic` or `square` represents the Magic Square, where `magic[i, j]` or `square[i, j]` is the value of the cell at row i and column j.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\nThe key constraints in these models are:\n\n* Each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly i times in the sequence (or square).\n* The sum of the values in each row, column, and diagonal of the square is equal to a constant magic sum.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of these models is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.\n\nNote that Models 1-4 represent the Magic Sequence problem, while Models 5 and 6 represent the Magic Square problem. Model 5 uses a more concise representation of the Magic Square, while Model 6 uses a more explicit representation with binary variables.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    **Model 1, 2, 3, and 4: Magic Sequence**\n\nname: Magic Sequence\n\ndescription: A magic sequence of length n is a sequence of integers x0, ..., xn-1 between 0 and n-1, such that for all i in 0 to n-1, the number i occurs exactly xi times in the sequence.\n\nvariables: s (array of var 0..n-1)\n\nThe decision variable s is an array of length n, where each element si represents the number of times the integer i appears in the sequence.\n\nconstraints: \nforall(i in 0..n-1) (s[i] = sum(j in 0..n-1) (bool2int(s[j] = i)))\nsum(i in 0..n-1) (s[i]) = n\nsum(i in 0..n-1) (s[i]*i) = n\ndistribute(s, value, s)\nglobal_cardinality(s, array1d(0..n-1, set2array(index_set(s))), s)\n\nThe constraints ensure that each number i in the sequence appears exactly si times, the sum of all si is equal to n, and the sum of all si*i is equal to n.

The goal is to find the pattern with the maximum number of live cells.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Maximum Density Still Life\n\ndescription: The Maximum Density Still Life problem is a classic problem in constraint programming, which involves finding a stable pattern of live and dead cells in a grid, such that the density of live cells is maximized. The problem is inspired by Conway's Game of Life, where live cells follow certain rules to survive or die in each generation. In this problem, the goal is to find a pattern that is stable, meaning it does not change over time, and has the maximum number of live cells.\n\nvariables: `grid[r,c]` for `r, c in augmentedBoardCoord`\n\nThe decision variables are the elements of the `grid` array, which represent the state of each cell in the grid. The value of `grid[r,c]` is 0 if the cell at row `r` and column `c` is dead, and 1 if it is live.\n\nconstraints: \n`grid[0,x] = 0 /\\ grid[1,x] = 0 /\\ grid[size+2,x] = 0 /\\ grid[size+3,x] = 0 /\\ grid[x,0] == 0 /\\ grid[x,1] == 0 /\\ grid[x,size+2] = 0 /\\ grid[x,size+3] = 0` for `x in augmentedBoardCoord`\n`((grid[r-1,c-1] + grid[r-1,c] + grid[r-1,c+1] + grid[r,c-1] + grid[r,c+1] + grid[r+1,c-1] + grid[r+1,c] + grid[r+1,c+1] ) = 3) -> (grid[r,c] = 1)` for `r, c in checkConstraintsBoardCoord`\n`(grid[r,c] = 1) -> (2 <= (grid[r-1,c-1] + grid[r-1,c] + grid[r-1,c+1] + grid[r,c-1] + grid[r,c+1] + grid[r+1,c-1] + grid[r+1,c] + grid[r+1,c+1] ) <= 3)` for `r, c in checkConstraintsBoardCoord`\n`grid[2,2] >= grid[size+1,size+1] /\\ grid[2,size+1] >= grid[size+1,2]`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the pattern is stable and follows the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The first constraint sets the boundary cells to be dead. The second constraint ensures that each cell with exactly three live neighbors is alive. The third constraint ensures that each live cell has two or three live neighbors. The last constraint is a symmetry-breaking constraint, which forces the assignment to respect an ordering on the values that occur in corner entries of the board.\n\nobjective: Maximize `z = sum(r in objFunctionBoardCoord, c in objFunctionBoardCoord) (grid[r,c])`\n\nThe objective is to maximize the number of live cells in the grid, which is represented by the variable `z`.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 8021, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b18b8e0-14d4-43e7-ab56-89409ed526eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b18b8e0-14d4-43e7-ab56-89409ed526eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "mip"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "mip_beginner_medium_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "mip"}, "hash": "d39f47739e3495005ed96082a078a53d1d9b5a5fe8376671479f7b87ec4e0a41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n                    ------\n                    Model 1 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.0*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 2 : \n\n\nvar float: B;\nvar float: C;\nvar float: D;\n\n\nsolve maximize 1.0*B - 1.0*C + 1.0*D;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 1.0*C + 2.0*D <=  4.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B - 3.0*C + 1.0*D <= -5.0;\nconstraint -1.0*B + 1.0*C - 2.0*D <= -1.0;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 3 :\n\n\nvar int: B;\nvar int: C;\nvar int: D;\n\nconstraint 2.0*B + 2.0*C + 1.0*D <= 30.0;\nconstraint 1.5*B + 2.0*C + 3.0*D <= 25.0;\nconstraint 2.0*B + 1.0*C + 1.0*D <= 20.0;\nsolve maximize 3.0*B + 1.0*C + 3.0*D;\n\nconstraint B >= 0 /\\ C >= 0 /\\ D >= 0\n\n\n\nModel 4 :\n\n\nsolve maximize 21*x + 11*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint 7*x + 4*y <= 13;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n\n\n\nModel 5 : \n\n\nsolve maximize 8*x + 5*y;\n\nvar int: x;\nvar int: y;\nconstraint x + y <= 6;\nconstraint 9*x + 5*y <= 45;\nconstraint x >= 0 /\\ y >= 0; \n\n                    ======\n                    Description 1:\n                    ------\n                    **Problem Name:** Resource Allocation Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three types of resources (let's call them B, C, and D) and you want to allocate them in the best way possible to maximize your profit or benefit.

These variables can take on non-negative values, indicating the amount of each product or activity to allocate.\n\n**Key Constraints:**\nThe constraints can be described as follows:\n\n* The total amount of resources used by the three products or activities cannot exceed certain limits (e.g., 30, 25, and 20 units).\n* Each product or activity has a specific resource requirement, and the total resource usage must not exceed the available resources.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit or value obtained from the allocation of resources to the three products or activities.

Imagine you have a grid of squares, and you need to fill some of them with colors (let's say black and white) to create a specific image. The rules tell you how many consecutive squares of each color should be in each row and column.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `x` or `A`: a 2D array that represents the grid of squares, where each square can be either 1 (white) or 2 (black).\n* `rows` and `cols`: 2D arrays that contain the rules for each row and column, respectively.\n* `row_rules` and `col_rules`: 2D arrays that contain the specific rules for each row and column.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each row and column must follow the rules specified in `rows` and `cols`, respectively.\n* The rules specify how many consecutive squares of each color should be in each row and column.\n\n**Goal:**\nThe goal is to find a valid configuration of the grid that satisfies all the rules, creating a specific image.\n\nIn simpler terms, the problem is about solving a puzzle where you need to fill a grid with black and white squares according to some rules, and the goal is to create a specific picture.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is called the Nonogram problem.\n\nThe Nonogram problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves solving a puzzle where a set of clues are given to determine the state of a grid. The grid is divided into rows and columns, and each row and column has a set of clues that specify the pattern of states in that row or column. The goal is to determine the state of each cell in the grid such that the clues are satisfied.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of each cell in the grid, which are represented by the `x` or `A` arrays in the models. These variables can take on two values, typically 0 and 1, or \" \" and \"#\", which represent the two possible states of a cell.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are the clues, which are specified by the `row_rules` and `col_rules` arrays in the models. These clues specify the pattern of states in each row and column, and the constraints ensure that the states of the cells in each row and column satisfy these patterns.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all the clues, and there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize.\n\nIn simpler terms, the Nonogram problem is like solving a puzzle where you have to figure out the state of each cell in a grid based on clues about the patterns of states in each row and column. The clues are like hints that help you determine the solution, and the goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the clues.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Nonogram\n\ndescription: A Nonogram is a puzzle where a set of clues are given to fill in a grid with two colors (usually black and white).

Imagine you have a list of tasks to complete, like laying foundations, building walls, installing doors and windows, and putting on a roof. Each task takes a certain amount of time to finish.\n\n**Main Variables:**\n\n* **Tasks**: These are the individual jobs that need to be done to build the house, like laying foundations or installing doors.\n* **Duration**: This is how long each task takes to complete.\n* **Start time**: This is when each task begins.\n* **Makespan**: This is the total time it takes to complete all the tasks.\n\n**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**\n\n* Some tasks can't start until others are finished. For example, you can't start building walls until the foundations are laid.\n* Some tasks can't happen at the same time. For example, you can't be building the interior walls and exterior walls at the same time.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find the order and timing of the tasks that will allow you to build the house in the shortest amount of time possible.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is called the \"Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem\" (RCPSP).\n\nThis problem is about scheduling a set of tasks with given durations and precedence constraints, where some tasks cannot start until others are finished. The goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the total duration of the project, also known as the \"makespan\".\n\nThe main decision variables are the start times of each task, represented by the `start` array. Each element `start[t]` represents the start time of task `t`.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* Precedence constraints: each task can only start after its predecessors have finished. For example, the task \"interior walls\" cannot start until the task \"foundations\" has finished.\n* Non-overlap constraints: certain tasks, such as carpentry tasks, cannot overlap with each other. For example, the tasks \"interior walls\" and \"exterior walls\" cannot be performed at the same time.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the maximum finish time of all tasks. In other words, the goal is to complete the project as quickly as possible.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)\n\ndescription: The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a classic problem in operations research and project management.

problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Quasigroup existence problem\n\n**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a table with numbers from 1 to n, where n is a given number. You need to fill this table in a special way, so that each row and each column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, there are some rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* `quasiGroup`: a table (or matrix) with numbers from 1 to n, where each row and column contains each number exactly once.\n* `qgDiagonal`: a list of numbers that represents the diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each row and each column of the `quasiGroup` table should contain each number exactly once.\n* There are some specific rules about how the numbers in the table should be related to each other, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The diagonal of the `quasiGroup` table should also satisfy some specific rules.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a `quasiGroup` table that satisfies all the rules and restrictions.\n\nNote that the problem is about finding a specific type of mathematical structure called a quasigroup, which is a set with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties. The problem is to find a quasigroup of a given order (i.e., with a given number of elements).\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem represented by these Minizinc models is the Quasigroup Existence Problem, also known as the Quasigroup Completion Problem.\n\nThe Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves finding a multiplication table for a quasigroup of a given order. A quasigroup is a mathematical structure that satisfies certain properties, similar to a group, but without the requirement of associativity.\n\nIn this problem, we are given an integer `n`, and we need to find an `n x n` multiplication table, represented by the `quasiGroup` array, such that each element in the table is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. The table must satisfy certain constraints, which are:\n\n* Each row and column must contain each integer between 0 and `n-1` exactly once (i.e., all rows and columns must be different).\n* The table must satisfy certain multiplication axioms, such as `(b*a)*b = a*(b*a)` or `(j*i)*(i*j) = i`.\n* The table must also satisfy some implied constraints, such as idempotency (i.e., `quasiGroup[i,i] = i`) and anti-Abelian properties (i.e., `quasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i]` for `i != j`).\n\nThe decision variables in this problem are the elements of the `quasiGroup` array, which represent the multiplication table.\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.\n\nThe problem is challenging because the constraints are complex and interconnected, making it difficult to find a solution that satisfies all of them. The Quasigroup Existence Problem has applications in various fields, including combinatorics, algebra, and computer science.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Quasigroup Existence Problem\n\ndescription: The Quasigroup Existence Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics, which involves finding a multiplication table of size n x n, where each element is an integer from 1 to n, such that each row and column contains each element exactly once, and certain multiplication axioms hold.\n\nvariables: quasiGroup[row, col], qgDiagonal[i]\n\nThe decision variables are a 2D array quasiGroup, where quasiGroup[row, col] represents the element at row and column in the multiplication table, and a 1D array qgDiagonal, where qgDiagonal[i] represents the diagonal element at position i.\n\nconstraints: \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | col in nDomain]) /\\ \nall_different([quasiGroup[row,col] | row in nDomain]) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,i] = i /\\ \nquasiGroup[quasiGroup[j,i],quasiGroup[i,j]] = i /\\ \nall_different(qgDiagonal) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,j] != quasiGroup[j,i] /\\ \n(quasiGroup[i,i]=j) -> (quasiGroup[j,j]=i) /\\ \nquasiGroup[i,n-1] + 2 >= i\n\nThe constraints ensure that:\n- Each row and column contains each element exactly once.\n- The diagonal elements are equal to their indices.\n- The multiplication axiom (b*a)*b = a*(b*a) holds.\n- The diagonal elements are all different.\n- The table is anti-Abelian, i.e., quasiGroup[i,j] is not equal to quasiGroup[j,i] for i != j.\n- If (i*i)=j then (j*j) = i.\n- Symmetry-breaking constraints to reduce the search space.\n\nobjective: The problem is a satisfaction problem, i.e., it does not have an objective function to minimize or maximize.

Each task takes a certain amount of time to complete and uses a certain amount of resources.\n\n**Main variables:**\n\n* Tasks: These are the individual jobs that need to be done.\n* Resources: These are the machines, workers, or other things needed to complete the tasks.\n* Start time: This is when each task will begin.\n* Duration: This is how long each task will take to complete.\n* Resource usage: This is how much of each resource is needed for each task.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules:**\n\n* Each task must be done after its predecessors (tasks that need to be finished before it can start).\n* Each resource has a limited capacity, and the total usage of that resource by all tasks cannot exceed that capacity.\n* Each task must start after its predecessors have finished.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find a schedule that completes all tasks as quickly as possible, while following the rules and restrictions above.

Each `s[t]` represents the start time of task `t`.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Precedence constraints: Each task can only start after its predecessors have finished. This is ensured by the constraint `s[pre[p,1]] + d[pre[p,1]] <= s[pre[p,2]]`, which states that the start time of a task plus its duration must be less than or equal to the start time of its successor.\n* Resource constraints: The total resource usage of all tasks at any given time must not exceed the available resource limit. This is ensured by the cumulative constraint, which is implemented using the `cumulative` function from the `cumulative.mzn` library.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the maximum completion time of all tasks, which is equivalent to minimizing the project duration. This is achieved by minimizing the maximum value of `s[t] + d[t]` across all tasks `t`.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)\n\ndescription: The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a classic problem in operations research and project management.

Imagine you have a certain number of people and a certain number of tables, and each table can only fit a certain number of people.\n\n**Main Variables:**\n\n* `n`: The total number of people.\n* `T`: The number of tables.\n* `S`: The maximum number of people that can sit at each table.\n* `couples`: Pairs of people who want to sit together.\n* `key`: A set of special people who cannot sit together.\n* `table`: An array that shows which people are sitting at each table.\n* `seat`: An array that shows which table each person is sitting at.\n\n**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**\n\n* Each table can only fit a certain number of people (S).\n* Each person must sit at a table.\n* Couples want to sit together at the same table.\n* Special people in the `key` set cannot sit together.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find a seating arrangement that minimizes the total table numbers of all couples. In other words, we want to find a way to seat the couples together at tables with the lowest possible table numbers.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The Social Golfer Problem.\n\nThis problem is about assigning golfers to tables for a social golfing event. The goal is to seat golfers in a way that maximizes social interaction while respecting certain constraints.\n\nThe main decision variables are:\n\n* `table`: a 2D array that represents the assignment of golfers to tables. Each element `table[t]` is a set of golfers assigned to table `t`.\n* `seat`: a 1D array that represents the assignment of golfers to tables. Each element `seat[p]` is the table number assigned to golfer `p`.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n* Each table can have at most `S` golfers.\n* Each golfer must be assigned to exactly one table.\n* Couples (defined in the `couples` array) must not be seated at the same table.\n* Golfers in the `key` set must not be seated at the same table.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the sum of table numbers assigned to couples. In other words, the goal is to seat couples at tables with the lowest possible numbers, while respecting the constraints.\n\nThe problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem, and the Minizinc models provided use a combination of set variables, array variables, and constraints to model the problem.

Imagine you're standing at a crossroads where four roads meet, and there are traffic lights for both cars and pedestrians.\n\n**Main Variables:**\n\n* `V1` to `V4`: These represent the traffic lights for cars, which can be red, red-yellow, green, or yellow.\n* `P1` to `P4`: These represent the traffic lights for pedestrians, which can be red or green.\n\n**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**\n\n* The traffic lights for cars and pedestrians at each intersection must follow certain rules, such as:\n\t+ When the car light is red, the pedestrian light must be red too.\n\t+ When the car light is green, the pedestrian light must be green too.\n\t+ When the car light is red-yellow, the pedestrian light must be yellow, and so on.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence of traffic light settings that satisfy these rules and ensure safe and efficient traffic flow.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is known as the Traffic Lights Problem.\n\nThis problem is about scheduling the traffic lights at a four-way junction to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow.

For example, if the traffic light for vehicles on one road is green, the traffic light for pedestrians on the adjacent road must be red.\n* The traffic lights must follow a specific sequence to ensure smooth traffic flow.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible schedule for the traffic lights that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIn this model, the constraints are represented using quaternary constraints, which specify the allowed combinations of states for the traffic lights at adjacent roads. The model uses a table constraint to enforce these quaternary constraints. The objective is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, and the model uses the \"satisfy\" objective to achieve this.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Traffic Lights Problem\n\ndescription: The Traffic Lights Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves finding a valid configuration of traffic lights at a four-way junction.

pint bucket) in the smallest number of transfers.\n%\n% The generalization consists in making the specification parametric with respect to the start and goal configurations, which are now inputs to

             Here is the explanation of the problem:\n\n**Name of the problem:** Water Buckets Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have three buckets of different sizes (8, 5, and 3 pints) and you want to divide a certain amount of water between them in a specific way. You can pour water from one bucket to another, but you want to do it in the fewest number of steps possible.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `state`: an array that represents the amount of water in each bucket at each step\n* `goal_step`: the number of steps it takes to reach the desired goal\n* `buckets`: the three buckets of different sizes\n* `capacity`: the maximum amount of water each bucket can hold\n* `start` and `goal`: the initial and desired amounts of water in each bucket\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* The total amount of water remains the same at each step\n* The amount of water in each bucket can only change by pouring water from one bucket to another\n* After each step, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full\n* The goal is to reach the desired amounts of water in each bucket in the fewest number of steps possible\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Minimize the number of steps (`goal_step`) it takes to reach the desired goal.\n\nNote that Model 2 appears to be a different problem, but it's actually a reformulation of the same Water Buckets Problem using a different modeling approach.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is known as the Water Buckets Problem.\n\nThis problem is about dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a desired distribution of water in the buckets.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of the buckets at each time step, represented by the `state` array in the model. Each element of the array represents the amount of water in a particular bucket at a particular time step.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* The initial state of the buckets is specified by the `start` array.\n* The goal state of the buckets is specified by the `goal` array.\n* At each time step, the amount of water in each bucket must be within its capacity.\n* The total amount of water remains constant throughout the process.\n* At each step, exactly two buckets change their water levels.\n* After each transfer, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the number of transfers required to reach the goal state from the initial state.\n\nIn the second model, the problem is represented as a finite state machine, where the states are the possible configurations of the buckets, and the transitions between states are the pouring operations. The goal is to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Water Buckets Problem\n\ndescription: The Water Buckets Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming. It involves dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a specific goal configuration of water in the buckets.\n\nvariables: `state[steps, buckets]`, `goal_step`\n\nThe decision variables are `state[steps, buckets]`, which represents the amount of water in each bucket at each time step, and `goal_step`, which represents the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.\n\nconstraints: \n`start[b] <= capacity[b]`, `goal[b] <= capacity[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(start[b]) = sum(b in buckets)(goal[b])`, \n`state[1,b]=start[b]`, `state[goal_step,b] = goal[b]`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(bool2int(state[step,b] != state[step+1, b])) = 2`, \n`sum(b in buckets)(state[step,b]) = sum(b in buckets)(state[step+1,b])`, \n`((state[step, b1] != state[step+1, b1]) /\\ (state[step, b2] != state[step, b2])) -> (state[step+1,b1] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b1] = capacity[b1] \\/ state[step+1,b2] = 0 \\/ state[step+1,b2] = capacity[b2])`\n\nThe constraints ensure that the initial and goal configurations are within the capacity of the buckets, the total amount of water is conserved, the initial and goal configurations are reached, exactly two buckets change in each step, the total amount of water is conserved in each step, and the pouring operation is valid (i.e., the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full).\n\nobjective: `minimize goal_step`\n\nThe objective is to minimize the number of steps required to reach the goal configuration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 11132, "text_template":
