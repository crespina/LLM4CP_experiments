the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have 12 different musical notes (like C, C#, D, etc.). You want to arrange these notes in a special order so that each note appears only once, and the distance between each pair of adjacent notes is different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes. For example, if the distance between the first two notes is 2 semitones, then there should be no other pair of adjacent notes with a distance of 2 semitones.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `x` or `series`: an array of 12 variables, each representing a musical note (0 to 11). This array represents the order in which the notes will be played.\n* `diffs` or `differences`: an array of variables representing the distance between each pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each note must appear only once in the series.\n* The distance between each pair of adjacent notes must be different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Find an arrangement of the 12 notes that satisfies the above rules.\n\nNote that the different models provided are different ways of solving the same problem, but the underlying problem remains the same.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is the All-Interval Series Problem.\n\nThe All-Interval Series Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves finding a series of pitch classes (represented by numbers 0 to 11) such that each pitch class occurs exactly once, and the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the pitch classes, represented by an array `x` or `series` in the models, which is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each pitch class occurs exactly once (i.e., the array `x` or `series` is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11).\n* The differences between neighboring notes are all different (i.e., the intervals between consecutive pitch classes are all unique).\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a series that satisfies these constraints.\n\nNote that there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize in this problem.

The profit is calculated as the sum of the profits obtained from each task-worker pair.\n\nIn the provided models, the profit is represented by the `profit` array, where `profit[w,t]` represents the profit obtained from assigning task `t` to worker `w`. The objective is to maximize the sum of these profits.\n\nThe models use different constraints and search strategies to solve the problem. Model 1 uses the `alldifferent` constraint to ensure that the assignments are unique, while Model 2 uses the `inverse` constraint to achieve the same goal.

Each variable can take an integer value between 1 and nc, where nc is the number of colours available.\n\nThe key constraints are that adjacent regions must have different colours. For example, Western Australia and Northern Territory must have different colours, as must Western Australia and South Australia, and so on. These constraints are represented by the \"!=\" constraints in the model, which ensure that the colours assigned to adjacent regions are not equal.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to find a feasible assignment of colours to the regions, such that all the constraints are satisfied. In other words, the goal is to find a colouring of the Australian map using the available colours, such that no two adjacent regions have the same colour.
