Problem\n\n**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have 12 different musical notes (like C, C#, D, etc.). You want to arrange these notes in a special order so that each note appears only once, and the distance between each pair of adjacent notes is different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes. For example, if the distance between the first two notes is 2 semitones, then there should be no other pair of adjacent notes with a distance of 2 semitones.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `x` or `series`: an array of 12 variables, each representing a musical note (0 to 11). This array represents the order in which the notes will be played.\n* `diffs` or `differences`: an array of variables representing the distance between each pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* Each note must appear only once in the series.\n* The distance between each pair of adjacent notes must be different from the distance between any other pair of adjacent notes.\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Find an arrangement of the 12 notes that satisfies the above rules.\n\nNote that the different models provided are different ways of solving the same problem, but the underlying problem remains the same.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is the All-Interval Series Problem.\n\nThe All-Interval Series Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves finding a series of pitch classes (represented by numbers 0 to 11) such that each pitch class occurs exactly once, and the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the pitch classes, represented by an array `x` or `series` in the models, which is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each pitch class occurs exactly once (i.e., the array `x` or `series` is a permutation of the set of integers from 0 to 11).\n* The differences between neighboring notes are all different (i.e., the intervals between consecutive pitch classes are all unique).\n\nThe objective of this problem is to find a series that satisfies these constraints.\n\nNote that there is no explicit objective function to minimize or maximize in this problem.

For example, `x[w]` represents the task assigned to worker `w`.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each task is assigned to exactly one worker.\n* Each worker is assigned to exactly one task.\n* The assignments must be unique, meaning that no two workers can be assigned the same task, and no two tasks can be assigned to the same worker.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to maximize the total profit obtained from the assignments. The profit is calculated as the sum of the profits obtained from each task-worker pair.\n\nIn the provided models, the profit is represented by the `profit` array, where `profit[w,t]` represents the profit obtained from assigning task `t` to worker `w`. The objective is to maximize the sum of these profits.\n\nThe models use different constraints and search strategies to solve the problem.

For example, if we have two copies of the digits 1 to 4, a valid solution would be `41312432`, where each digit appears twice, and the distance between consecutive appearances of the same digit is equal to the digit's value.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Langford's Problem\n\ndescription: Langford's problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves arranging m copies of digits 1 to n in a sequence such that any two consecutive copies of digit k are separated by k other digits.\n\nvariables: x[d,c], y[p] \nx[d,c] represents the position of the c-th copy of digit d in the sequence, and y[p] represents the digit at position p in the sequence. \n\nconstraints: \nalldifferent([x[d,c] | d in DIG, c in COPY]), \ninverse([x[d,c] | d in DIG, c in COPY], y), \nforall(d in DIG, c in 1..m-1) (x[d,c+1] = x[d,c] + d + 1), \nalldifferent(y), \nforall(d in DIG, c in 1..m-1, p in POS) (y[p] = m*(d-1) + c <-> y[p+d+1] = m*(d-1) + c + 1)\n\nThe first constraint ensures that all positions in the sequence are distinct.

You can pour water from one bucket to another, but you want to do it in the fewest number of steps possible.\n\n**Main variables and what they mean:**\n\n* `state`: an array that represents the amount of water in each bucket at each step\n* `goal_step`: the number of steps it takes to reach the desired goal\n* `buckets`: the three buckets of different sizes\n* `capacity`: the maximum amount of water each bucket can hold\n* `start` and `goal`: the initial and desired amounts of water in each bucket\n\n**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**\n\n* The total amount of water remains the same at each step\n* The amount of water in each bucket can only change by pouring water from one bucket to another\n* After each step, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full\n* The goal is to reach the desired amounts of water in each bucket in the fewest number of steps possible\n\n**Goal of the problem:** Minimize the number of steps (`goal_step`) it takes to reach the desired goal.\n\nNote that Model 2 appears to be a different problem, but it's actually a reformulation of the same Water Buckets Problem using a different modeling approach.\n                    ======\n                    Description 2:\n                    ---------\n                    The problem is known as the Water Buckets Problem.\n\nThis problem is about dividing a certain amount of water into two buckets of specific capacities using a series of pouring operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of transfers required to achieve a desired distribution of water in the buckets.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are the states of the buckets at each time step, represented by the `state` array in the model. Each element of the array represents the amount of water in a particular bucket at a particular time step.\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* The initial state of the buckets is specified by the `start` array.\n* The goal state of the buckets is specified by the `goal` array.\n* At each time step, the amount of water in each bucket must be within its capacity.\n* The total amount of water remains constant throughout the process.\n* At each step, exactly two buckets change their water levels.\n* After each transfer, either the source bucket becomes empty or the target bucket becomes full.\n\nThe objective of the problem is to minimize the number of transfers required to reach the goal state from the initial state.\n\nIn the second model, the problem is represented as a finite state machine, where the states are the possible configurations of the buckets, and the transitions between states are the pouring operations. The goal is to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.\n                    ======\n                    Description 3:\n                    ---------\n                    name: Water Buckets Problem\n\ndescription: The Water Buckets Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming.

variables are `state[steps, buckets]`, which represents the amount of water in each bucket at each time step, and `goal_step`, which represents the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal
