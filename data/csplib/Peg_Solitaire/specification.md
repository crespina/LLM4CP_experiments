Peg Solitaire (also known as Hi-Q) is played on a board with a number of holes. In the English version of the game, the board is in the shape of a cross with 33 holes:

      OOO
      OOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
      OOO
      OOO

Pegs ('X's here) are arranged on the board so that at least one hole remains. A number of different problems arise from Solitaire, e.g. finding a path from the initial to a goal state, or finding the shortest number of moves to a state where no more moves are possible.

Moves are draughts/checkers-like and are horizontal or vertical: 

    XXO -> OOX

The following is the classic 'central' version of the game:

     Start:     Goal:
      XXX        OOO
      XXX        OOO
    XXXXXXX    OOOOOOO
    XXXOXXX -> OOOXOOO
    XXXXXXX    OOOOOOO
      XXX        OOO
      XXX        OOO

The French version of the game has four extra holes: 

      OOO
     OOOOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
    OOOOOOO
     OOOOO
      OOO

The french version of solitaire cannot be completed starting with one hole in the middle, and
ending with one peg in the center, without adding one extra peg during play (the player gets
to decide where and when to place the extra peg).

Other board types, such as the Solitaire Triangle, also exist.
