Molnar originally posed the following problem to construct a $k \times
k$ matrix

$$\begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11}  & \ldots & a_{1k}\\\\\\\\
\vdots & \ldots & \vdots\\\\\\\
a_{k1}  & \ldots & a_{kk} 
\end{pmatrix}$$

such that:

$$\det \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11}  & \ldots & a_{1k}\\\\\\\\
\vdots & \ldots & \vdots\\\\\\\\
a_{k1}  & \ldots & a_{kk} 
\end{pmatrix} 
 = 1, \ 
\det \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11}^2  & \ldots & a_{1k}^2 \\\\\\\\
\vdots & \ldots & \vdots  \\\\\\\\
a_{k1}^2  & \ldots & a_{kk}^2 
\end{pmatrix} 
 = \pm 1$$


where the $a_{ii}$ are integers not equal to plus or minus 1, and
$\det$ denotes the <A

of a matrix. The solutions to this problem are significant in
classifying certain types of topological spaces. Guy discusses a
variant where 0 entries are also disallowed and the sign of both
determinants must be positive.
