Title:    Blocked n-Queens Problem

Overview
========

The {prob054} Problem, [prob054], suffers from the problem that its complexity is trivial as a decision problem.  
The Blocked n-Queens problems is a variant of {prob054} which has been proven to
be NP-Complete as a decision problem and #P-Complete as a counting problem.


The Blocked $n$-Queens problem is a variant where, as well as $n$, the input contains a list of squares which are blocked. A solution to the problem is a solution to the $n$-Queens problem containing no queens on any of the blocked 
squares.

The Blocked $n$-Queens problem is closely related to {prob079}, [prob079].


Instances
==========================

Python generators are available to implement the model from the paper cite{nqueenscompletion}.

Also provided are instances from the ASP Competitions (thanks to Martin Gebser for providing these.)   Results of ASP solvers on those instances can be found at

References
==========

The Blocked $n$-Queens problem was proposed by cite{blocked-queens} and used in ASP Competitions
cite{asp-competition-07}. The problem was proved NP-Complete and #P-Complete by cite{nqueenscompletion}, and the same paper 
introduced a generator of ranodm instances.
