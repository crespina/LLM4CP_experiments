The resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a classical well-known problem in operations research. 
A number of activities are to be scheduled. Each activity has a duration and cannot be interrupted. 
There are a set of precedence relations between pairs of activities which state that the second activity must start after the first has finished.
The set of precedence relations are usually given as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the edge (*u*,*v*) represents a precedence relation where *u* must finish before *v* begins. The DAG contains two additional activities with duration 0, the *source* and *sink*, where the *source* is the first activity and *sink* is the last activity (these are dummy activities).  

There are a set of renewable resources. Each resource has a maximum capacity and at any given time slot no more than this amount can be in use. Each activity has a demand (possibly zero) on each resource. The dummy *source* and *sink* activities have zero demand on all resources. 

The problem is usually stated as an optimisation problem where the makespan (i.e. the completion time of the *sink* activity) is minimised. 

## Multi-mode Variant

An extension of the basic RCPSP is the *multi-mode* variant where activities may have multiple *modes*. The mode dictates the duration and resource demands of the activity. In this variant, the schedule must give the mode of each activity as well as its starting time. 

## Non-Renewable Resources

Another extension concerns *non-renewable resources*. Each non-renewable resource has a capacity for the entire schedule. An example would be a financial budget that applies to the entire project. Modes of activities must be chosen to avoid exceeding the capacity of each of the non-renewable resources.
