The problem is known as the Traffic Lights Problem.

This problem is about scheduling the traffic lights at a four-way junction to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. The junction has eight traffic lights: four for vehicles and four for pedestrians. Each traffic light can be in one of four states: red, red-yellow, green, or yellow.

The main decision variables are:

* V1 to V4, which represent the states of the traffic lights for vehicles
* P1 to P4, which represent the states of the traffic lights for pedestrians

The key constraints are:

* At any given time, the traffic lights for vehicles and pedestrians at adjacent roads must be in a safe and compatible state. For example, if the traffic light for vehicles on one road is green, the traffic light for pedestrians on the adjacent road must be red.
* The traffic lights must follow a specific sequence to ensure smooth traffic flow.

The objective of the problem is to find a feasible schedule for the traffic lights that satisfies all the constraints.

In this model, the constraints are represented using quaternary constraints, which specify the allowed combinations of states for the traffic lights at adjacent roads. The model uses a table constraint to enforce these quaternary constraints. The objective is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, and the model uses the "satisfy" objective to achieve this.
