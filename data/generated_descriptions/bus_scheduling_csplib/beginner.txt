Bus Driver Scheduling Problem

This problem is about creating a schedule for bus drivers to cover all the tasks (like driving routes) with the minimum number of drivers needed.

The main variables are:

* Tasks (or pieces of work): these are the bus routes or driving jobs that need to be covered.
* Shifts: these are the possible schedules for the bus drivers, which cover some of the tasks.
* x: this is a variable that decides which shifts to choose for the drivers.
* tot_shifts: this is the total number of shifts (or drivers) needed to cover all the tasks.

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* Each task must be covered by exactly one shift (or driver).
* Each shift can cover multiple tasks.
* We want to use the minimum number of shifts (or drivers) to cover all the tasks.

The goal of the problem is to minimize the total number of shifts (or drivers) needed to cover all the tasks.
