Magic Hexagon

This problem is about creating a special kind of hexagon (a six-sided shape) with numbers inside it. Imagine a hexagon divided into smaller triangles, and each triangle has a number in it.

The main variables are the numbers that go inside the triangles. There are 19 numbers in total, and they are represented by letters like a, b, c, and so on.

The basic rules of the problem are:

* Each triangle must have a different number in it.
* The numbers in each row of triangles must add up to 38.
* The numbers in each column of triangles must also add up to 38.
* Some specific triangles have to have smaller numbers than others.

The goal of the problem is to find a way to arrange the numbers in the triangles so that all the rules are followed.
