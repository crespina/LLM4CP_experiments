**Problem Name:** Square Packing Problem

**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have a set of squares of different sizes, and you want to pack them into a rectangle (a box with a length and a width) in a way that they don't overlap with each other. You want to find the smallest rectangle that can fit all the squares.

**Main variables:**

* `n`: The number of squares.
* `height` and `width`: The length and width of the rectangle.
* `x` and `y`: The coordinates (positions) of each square in the rectangle.
* `area`: The total area of the rectangle.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* Each square must fit inside the rectangle.
* No two squares can overlap with each other.
* The squares must be packed in a way that they don't stick out of the rectangle.

**Goal of the problem:** Find the smallest rectangle (with the smallest area) that can fit all the squares without any overlaps.
