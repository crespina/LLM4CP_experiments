Golomb Ruler Problem

The Golomb Ruler Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves finding a set of marks on a ruler such that the differences between all pairs of marks are distinct.

The main decision variables in this problem are the `mark` array, which represents the positions of the marks on the ruler, and the `differences` array, which represents the differences between all pairs of marks.

The key constraints in this problem are:

* The first mark is at position 0.
* Each mark is to the right of the previous mark.
* All differences between pairs of marks are distinct.
* A symmetry-breaking constraint to ensure that the solution is not mirrored.

The objective of the problem is to minimize the length of the ruler, which is represented by the position of the last mark (`mark[m]`).

In essence, the Golomb Ruler Problem is about finding the shortest ruler that can measure all distances up to a certain length, with the constraint that all distances must be unique.
