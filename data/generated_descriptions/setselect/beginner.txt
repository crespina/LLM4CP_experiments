**The Set Selection Problem**

**What is it about?**
Imagine you have a bunch of items, and you want to choose a few of them. These items are grouped into smaller sets, and you have some rules to follow when making your selection.

**Main variables:**

* `n`: The total number of items.
* `k`: The number of smaller sets that the items are grouped into.
* `s`: The smaller sets themselves, each containing some of the items.
* `x`: The selection of items you want to choose.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* You can only choose one item from each smaller set.
* The total number of items you choose is limited (this limit is `u` in some models).

**Goal:**
The goal is to choose the items that add up to the largest total value. In other words, you want to maximize the sum of the items you select.
