**Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem**

This problem is about planning a set of tasks that need to be done, using a limited amount of resources, like machines or workers. Each task takes a certain amount of time to complete and uses a certain amount of resources.

**Main variables:**

* Tasks: These are the individual jobs that need to be done.
* Resources: These are the machines, workers, or other things needed to complete the tasks.
* Start time: This is when each task will begin.
* Duration: This is how long each task will take to complete.
* Resource usage: This is how much of each resource is needed for each task.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* Each task must be done after its predecessors (tasks that need to be finished before it can start).
* Each resource has a limited capacity, and the total usage of that resource by all tasks cannot exceed that capacity.
* Each task must start after its predecessors have finished.

**Goal:**

The goal is to find a schedule that completes all tasks as quickly as possible, while following the rules and restrictions above. In other words, we want to minimize the total time it takes to complete all tasks.
