Vessel Loading

This problem is about loading containers onto a ship's deck. Imagine you have a bunch of boxes of different sizes and types, and you need to fit them onto a rectangular deck.

The main variables are:

* The width and length of the deck
* The number of containers and their classes (types)
* The width, length, and class of each container
* The minimum separation required between containers of different classes
* The position of each container on the deck (left, right, bottom, and top coordinates)
* The orientation of each container (whether it's turned 90 degrees or not)

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* Each container must fit within the deck's boundaries
* Containers cannot overlap with each other
* Containers of different classes must be separated by a minimum distance

The goal of the problem is to find a way to load all the containers onto the deck while following these rules.

Note: The output section of the code is used to print a visual representation of the loaded containers, but it's not essential to understanding the problem itself.
