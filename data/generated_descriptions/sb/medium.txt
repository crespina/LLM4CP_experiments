**Solitaire Battleships**

Solitaire Battleships is a classic constraint programming problem that involves filling a partially filled board with ships, respecting certain constraints.

**Decision Variables and Their Representation**

The main decision variables in this problem are:

* `board`: a 2D array representing the board, where each cell can take one of 7 possible values (water, submarine, left/right/top/bottom of a ship, or middle of a ship).
* `fill`: a 2D array indicating which pieces on the board are part of a ship.
* `npiece`: an array representing the number of each type of piece on the board.

**Key Constraints**

The key constraints in this problem are:

* **Hints**: The initial board configuration must be respected, i.e., if a cell has a hint, it must be filled with the corresponding piece.
* **Spacing**: There must be gaps between ships, and ships cannot touch each other diagonally.
* **Ship Shape**: Each ship must have a valid shape, with left and right ends, top and bottom ends, and middle pieces.
* **Piece Sums**: The number of each type of piece on the board must match the given sums.
* **Row and Column Sums**: The number of filled cells in each row and column must match the given sums.

**Objective**

The objective of the problem is to find a valid configuration of the board that satisfies all the constraints.

In essence, the problem is to fill a partially filled board with ships, respecting the given constraints, to create a valid Solitaire Battleships puzzle solution.
