The problem is known as the Social Golfers Problem.

The Social Golfers Problem is about scheduling golfers into groups for multiple rounds of golf, such that each golfer plays with a different set of people in each round, and no two golfers play together more than once.

The main decision variables in this problem are:

* `round_place_golfer` (in Model 1) or `round_group_i_golfer` (in Model 2) or `round_group_golfers` (in Model 3) or `assign` (in Model 4), which represent the assignment of golfers to groups in each round.

The key constraints in this problem are:

* Each group in each round must have a distinct set of golfers.
* Each pair of golfers can play together at most once across all rounds.
* Symmetry-breaking constraints to reduce the search space and avoid duplicate solutions.

The objective of this problem is to find a feasible assignment of golfers to groups in each round, satisfying the above constraints.

Note that the problem does not have an explicit objective function to minimize or maximize, but rather aims to find a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.
