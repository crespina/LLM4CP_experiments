**Seating Arrangement Problem**

This problem is about arranging people in a line, like in a queue or at a table, in a specific order.

**Main Variables:**

* `n`: The number of people.
* `gender`: An array that stores the gender of each person (male or female).
* `age`: An array that stores the age of each person.
* `order`: An array that stores the order in which the people should be arranged.

**Basic Restrictions or Rules:**

* The people should be arranged in a line, one after the other.
* Males and females should alternate in the line (i.e., a male should be followed by a female, and vice versa).
* The age difference between two people sitting next to each other should not be more than 10 years.

**Goal:**

The goal is to find an arrangement of people that satisfies all the above rules. There is no specific goal to minimize or maximize anything; we just want to find a valid arrangement.
