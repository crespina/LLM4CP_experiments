SONET Problem

The SONET problem is about designing a network that connects certain nodes (think of them as computers or devices) in a way that uses the fewest resources possible.

The main variables are:

* Rings: These are like circles that connect nodes together. Each ring can hold a certain number of nodes.
* Nodes: These are the devices that need to be connected.
* Demand: This is a list of which nodes need to be connected to each other.
* Capacity nodes: This is the maximum number of nodes that can be on each ring.

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* If two nodes need to be connected, they must be on the same ring.
* Each ring can only hold a certain number of nodes, based on its capacity.

The goal of the problem is to use the fewest number of rings (and therefore the fewest resources) to connect all the nodes that need to be connected.
