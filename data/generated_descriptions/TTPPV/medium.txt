The Traveling Tournament Problem with Predefined Venues.

This problem is about scheduling a round-robin tournament where each team plays every other team exactly once, with the added constraint that the venue of each game has already been decided. The goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the total travel distance of all teams.

The main decision variables are:

* `opponent[i,k]`: the team that team `i` plays against in round `k`
* `venue[i,k]`: whether team `i` plays at home (1) or away (2) in round `k`
* `travel[i,k]`: the distance team `i` travels to play in round `k` (including the return journey after the last round)

The key constraints are:

* Each team plays every other team exactly once
* A team cannot play against itself
* The venue of each game is already decided and must be respected
* Each team has a different opponent in each round
* Each round has a different set of opponents
* No team can have more than three consecutive home games or away games
* The schedule is symmetric, so reversing the rounds would result in the same total travel distance

The objective is to minimize the total travel distance of all teams, which is calculated as the sum of the distances traveled by each team in each round.

In essence, this problem is about finding the most efficient schedule for a tournament, taking into account the pre-defined venues and the need to minimize travel distances.
