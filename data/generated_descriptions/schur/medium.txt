Schur's Numbers Problem

Schur's Numbers Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves placing labeled balls into boxes subject to certain constraints.

The problem is about distributing `n` balls, labeled from 1 to `n`, into `c` boxes such that no box contains a triple of balls `{x, y, z}` where `x + y = z`. In other words, the problem seeks to find an assignment of balls to boxes that avoids any arithmetic progression of length three.

The main decision variables in this problem are the `box` array, where `box[i]` represents the box number that ball `i` is assigned to.

The key constraints in this problem are:

* For any two balls `i` and `j`, if `i + j` is also a ball, then `i` and `j` cannot be in the same box, and `i` and `i + j` cannot be in the same box, and `j` and `i + j` cannot be in the same box. This ensures that no box contains a triple of balls that form an arithmetic progression.

The objective of this problem is to find a feasible assignment of balls to boxes that satisfies the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function. The `solve satisfy` statement in the model indicates that the goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than minimizing or maximizing a particular objective.
