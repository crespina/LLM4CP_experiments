The problem is known as the "Graceful Graph" problem.

The Graceful Graph problem is about labeling the nodes of a graph with integers from 1 to m, such that the absolute difference between the labels of two adjacent nodes is equal to the edge label connecting them. The goal is to find a labeling that satisfies this condition for all edges in the graph.

The main decision variables in this problem are:

* `nodes`: an array of variables representing the labels assigned to each node in the graph.
* `edges`: an array of variables representing the labels assigned to each edge in the graph.
* `graph`: a 2D array representing the adjacency matrix of the graph, where `graph[i,1]` and `graph[i,2]` represent the nodes connected by the `i`-th edge.

The key constraints in this problem are:

* For each edge, the absolute difference between the labels of the two nodes it connects must be equal to the edge label.
* All edge labels must be distinct.
* All node labels must be distinct.

The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all these constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function.

In this specific model, the graph is fixed and represented by the `graph` array, and the goal is to find a labeling of the nodes and edges that satisfies the graceful graph condition.
