**K4P2 Graceful Graph**

This problem is about creating a special kind of graph, which is like a network of connected points.

**Main variables:**

* **nodes**: These are the points in the graph, and we need to assign a number to each one.
* **graph**: This is the connection between the points, telling us which points are connected to each other.
* **edges**: These are the connections between the points, and we need to assign a number to each connection.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* The difference between the numbers of two connected points must be equal to the number of the connection between them.
* All connections must have different numbers.
* All points must have different numbers.

**Goal:**

The goal is to find a way to assign numbers to the points and connections so that all the rules are satisfied.
