**The Subset Sum Problem**

**What the problem is about in everyday terms:**
Imagine you have a set of items, each with a specific weight or value. You want to select a subset of these items such that their total weight or value adds up to a specific target value.

**Main variables and their meanings:**

* `number`: an array of integers representing the weights or values of the items.
* `target`: an integer representing the target value we want to reach.
* `selected`: a set of integers representing the indices of the items we choose to include in our subset.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* We can only choose items from the given set.
* The total weight or value of the selected items must equal the target value.

**Goal of the problem:**
Find a subset of items such that their total weight or value adds up to the target value.
