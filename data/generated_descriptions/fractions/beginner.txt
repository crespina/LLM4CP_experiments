Here is the explanation of the problem:

**Name of the problem:** Fractions problem

**What the problem is about:** Imagine you have 9 distinct digits (from 1 to 9) that you want to use to create three fractions that add up to 1. The fractions are created by combining the digits in a specific way.

**Main variables and their meanings:**

* A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I: These are the 9 distinct digits (from 1 to 9) that we want to use to create the fractions.
* D1, D2, D3: These are the denominators (the numbers at the bottom) of the three fractions.

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* Each digit can only be used once.
* The digits must be combined in a specific way to create the fractions.
* The three fractions must add up to 1.

**Goal of the problem:** Find a way to combine the 9 digits to create three fractions that add up to 1, while following the rules and restrictions mentioned above.
