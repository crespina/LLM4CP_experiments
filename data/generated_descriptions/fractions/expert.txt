name: Fractions Problem

description: The Fractions Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to find distinct non-zero digits such that the following equation holds: A/(BC) + D/(EF) + G/(HI) = 1.

variables: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, D1, D2, D3
These variables represent the digits in the equation. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I are the digits in the numerators and denominators of the fractions, and D1, D2, and D3 are intermediate variables used to calculate the denominators.

constraints: 
all_different(Vars) 
D1 = 10*B+C 
D2 = 10*E+F 
D3 = 10*H+I 
A*D2*D3 + D*D1*D3 + G*D1*D2 = D1*D2*D3 
A*D2 >= D*D1 
D*D3 >= G*D2 
3*A >= D1 
3*G <= D2

These constraints ensure that: 
- all digits are distinct, 
- the intermediate variables D1, D2, and D3 are correctly calculated, 
- the equation A/(BC) + D/(EF) + G/(HI) = 1 holds, 
- and some symmetry-breaking and redundant constraints are added to help the solver.

objective: satisfy
The objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than to minimize or maximize a specific value.
