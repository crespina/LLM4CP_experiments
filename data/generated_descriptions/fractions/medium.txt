The problem is known as the "Fractions Problem" or "Einstein's Fractions Problem".

This problem is about finding distinct non-zero digits (from 1 to 9) that satisfy a specific equation involving three fractions. The equation is:

(A / (B*C)) + (D / (E*F)) + (G / (H*I)) = 1

The main decision variables are the digits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, which represent the numerators and denominators of the three fractions.

The key constraints are:

* Each digit must be distinct and non-zero.
* The equation above must hold.
* Some symmetry-breaking constraints are added to reduce the search space:
	+ A*D2 >= D*D1 (to avoid swapping the first two fractions)
	+ D*D3 >= G*D2 (to avoid swapping the last two fractions)
* Some redundant constraints are added to help the solver:
	+ 3*A >= D1 (to reduce the possible values of A)
	+ 3*G <= D2 (to reduce the possible values of G)

The objective of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than to minimize or maximize a specific objective function. The problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem, where the goal is to find a feasible solution that meets all the constraints.
