The problem is the N-Queens Problem.

The N-Queens Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem where we need to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no queen attacks another queen. A queen can attack another queen if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.

The main decision variables in this problem are the positions of the queens on the chessboard, represented by the array `queens` of size N, where `queens[i]` represents the column number of the queen in the i-th row.

The key constraints in this problem are:

* Each queen must be placed in a different column (ensured by the `all_different` constraint).
* No two queens can be in the same diagonal (ensured by the constraints `queens[i] + i != queens[j] + j` and `queens[i] - i != queens[j] - j`).

The objective of this problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, i.e., to find a way to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no queen attacks another queen.

Note that there is no objective function to minimize or maximize in this problem, as the goal is simply to find a feasible solution.
