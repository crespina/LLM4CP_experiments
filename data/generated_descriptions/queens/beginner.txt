**The N-Queens Problem**

**What is it about?**
Imagine you have a chessboard with `n` rows and `n` columns. You want to place `n` queens on the board in such a way that no queen can attack another queen.

**Main variables:**
* `n`: the number of queens (and the size of the chessboard)
* `queens`: an array of `n` variables, each representing the column where a queen is placed in a particular row

**Basic restrictions or rules:**
* Each queen must be placed in a different column (no two queens can be in the same column)
* No queen can attack another queen diagonally (i.e., no two queens can be on the same diagonal)

**Goal:**
The goal is to find a way to place all `n` queens on the board such that they do not attack each other.
