**Traveling Salesman Problem**

This problem is about planning a route for a salesman who needs to visit a certain number of cities and return to the starting point.

**Main variables:**

* `n`: the number of cities
* `coord`: the coordinates of each city (think of it like the address of each city)
* `order`: the order in which the salesman visits each city
* `city`: the city at each position in the order

**Basic restrictions or rules:**

* The salesman must visit each city exactly once
* The salesman must follow the precedences (rules) that specify which city must be visited before another city
* The salesman must return to the starting point at the end of the route

**Goal:**

The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits all cities and returns to the starting point, while following the precedences and rules. In other words, we want to minimize the total distance traveled by the salesman.
