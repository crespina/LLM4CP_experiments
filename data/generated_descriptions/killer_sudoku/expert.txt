name: Killer Sudoku

description: Killer Sudoku is a puzzle that combines elements of Sudoku and Kakuro. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and nonet (3x3 sub-grid) contains each number exactly once. Additionally, the sum of all numbers in a "cage" (a group of cells) must match the small number printed in its corner.

variables: x[i, j] (i, j ∈ {1, ..., 9}) - decision variables representing the value of each cell in the grid.

constraints:
- ∀i ∈ {1, ..., 9} (∀j ∈ {1, ..., 9} x[i, j] ≠ x[i, k] ∧ ∀j ∈ {1, ..., 9} x[j, i] ≠ x[k, i]) - each row and column contains each number exactly once
- ∀i, j ∈ {0, ..., 2} (∀r, c ∈ {i*3+1, ..., i*3+3} × {j*3+1, ..., j*3+3} x[r, c] ≠ x[r', c'] for r ≠ r' or c ≠ c') - each nonet contains each number exactly once
- ∀p ∈ {1, ..., num_segments} (∑(i, j) ∈ {1, ..., n} × {1, ..., n} where segments[i, j] = p x[i, j] = segment_sums[p]) - the sum of all numbers in a cage must match the small number printed in its corner

objective: satisfy - the objective is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.
