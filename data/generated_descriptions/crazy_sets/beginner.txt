**Problem Name:** Unknown (no specific name is given)

**What the problem is about in everyday terms:** Imagine you have a set of numbers from 1 to 10, and you want to divide these numbers into 4 groups, each containing 4 numbers. The goal is to create these groups in a way that no three groups have a common number.

**Main variables and what they mean:**

* `n`: the maximum value in the set of numbers (in this case, 10)
* `c`: the number of elements in each group (in this case, 4)
* `m`: the number of groups (in this case, 4)
* `s`: an array of sets, where each set represents a group of numbers
* `x`: a 2D array of numbers, where each row represents a group and each column represents a position in the group

**Basic restrictions or rules of the problem:**

* Each group must have exactly 4 numbers.
* No three groups can have a common number.
* The numbers in each group must be in increasing order.
* The numbers in each group must be unique.

**Goal of the problem:** The goal is to find a way to divide the numbers into groups that satisfy all the rules and restrictions.

Note: The problem is not trying to minimize or maximize anything, it's just trying to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.
