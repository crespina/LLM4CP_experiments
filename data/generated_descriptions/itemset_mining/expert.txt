name: Market Basket Analysis

description: The Market Basket Analysis problem is a classic problem in data mining and constraint programming. It involves finding a set of items that are frequently purchased together in a transactional database. The goal is to identify a set of items that covers a minimum number of transactions, with a minimum total utility or value.

variables: Items ∈ 2^{1..NrI}

The decision variable Items is a set of items, represented as a subset of the universe of items {1..NrI}. It represents the set of items that are frequently purchased together.

constraints: 
card(cover(Items, TDB)) ≥ Freq
∑(i in Items)(itemprice[i]) ≥ minUtility

The first constraint ensures that the set of items covers at least Freq transactions in the transactional database TDB. The cover function is a custom function that returns the set of transactions that are covered by the items.

The second constraint ensures that the total utility or value of the items in the set is at least minUtility.

objective: satisfy

The objective of the problem is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints, rather than optimizing a specific objective function. The goal is to find a set of items that covers a minimum number of transactions with a minimum total utility or value.
